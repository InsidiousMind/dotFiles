2016-06-02 15:28:35	insidious15	NickServ isn't working at all for me, just always returns 'no such nick/channel' no matter the command
2016-06-02 15:29:12	insidious15	it was working fine, but i screwed up the permissoins for inspircd server and inspircd.conf. I fixed those, though, but now NickServ isn't working. I don't think those two are related, though
2016-06-02 15:29:21	tacocat	what commands have you tried
2016-06-02 15:29:35	tacocat	and are services linked properly? (see /map)
2016-06-02 15:31:06	insidious15	'/map just the domain 'irc.whatever.com' and the server, users and avg user
2016-06-02 15:31:15	insidious15	i'm trying to do /NickServ identify password
2016-06-02 15:31:16	insidious15	for my nick
2016-06-02 15:31:25	insidious15	or /NickServ help register
2016-06-02 15:31:35	insidious15	both return 'no such nick/channel'
2016-06-02 15:32:25	tacocat	if it doesn't show the services server it means that services haven't linked correctly
2016-06-02 15:32:27	tacocat	check your logs
2016-06-02 15:33:19	insidious15	where are the logs? sorry haha this is my second day doing this stuff
2016-06-02 15:35:52	insidious15	nvm
2016-06-02 15:36:00	insidious15	seems like i just didn't start the service
2016-06-02 15:36:13	insidious15	need to edit the service file so that it starts when I reboot my server
2016-06-02 15:36:15	insidious15	duh
