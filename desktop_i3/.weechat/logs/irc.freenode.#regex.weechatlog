2016-07-07 15:00:00	+lyxia	https://regex101.com/r/pE7hO7/3
2016-07-07 15:00:47	matthias__	lyxia: thanks, but it has no match groups on the right?
2016-07-07 15:01:13	+lyxia	well the group is the whole regex, I don't see how that's useful
2016-07-07 15:01:33	+turlutton	matthias__: match group doesn't exist, it's a -capture- group.
2016-07-07 15:02:39	+turlutton	matthias__: if you just want to get the whole regex, capture group are not needed. They are for extracting parts of the whole regex, to work later on.
2016-07-07 15:03:03	+turlutton	matthias__: for example, you could use it to get the title only
2016-07-07 15:03:37	matthias__	turlutton: adding round brackets around it, did what i want. i come from python and you do re.match().group()   
2016-07-07 15:04:00	+turlutton	like that https://regex101.com/r/pE7hO7/5
2016-07-07 15:04:43	+turlutton	matthias__: there is "code generator" below "tools", that you can use.
2016-07-07 15:05:12	+turlutton	I don't use it with python, but I suppose that you can get the match (not the capture) with $matches.
2016-07-07 15:05:24	+turlutton	($matches in the code generator example)
2016-07-07 15:05:41	+Doqnach	matthias__: or use a DOM parser in python
2016-07-07 15:05:49	+turlutton	Doqnach++
2016-07-07 15:06:02	+lyxia	group() doesn't make use of parentheses

2016-07-07 15:09:59	+turlutton	matthias__: wokay
2016-07-07 15:11:56	+turlutton	how the regex is constructed come into play too, but since you provided a rather poor example we couldn't try to improve much.

2016-07-07 15:26:26	doxinho	im doing this in the solarwinds orion console, maybe their regex is different/funky

2016-07-07 15:32:31	doxinho	yeah, the config file has double quotes around the user name
2016-07-07 15:32:37	+OnlineCop	You need that in the regex then.
2016-07-07 15:32:58	doxinho	username (?!"solarwinds").*
2016-07-07 15:33:04	+OnlineCop	 /username "(?!solarwinds")([^"]+)"/
2016-07-07 15:33:17	+OnlineCop	Do you want the double quotes matched as well?
2016-07-07 15:33:40	doxinho	that did it
