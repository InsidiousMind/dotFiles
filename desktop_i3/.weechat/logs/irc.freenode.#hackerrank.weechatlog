2016-09-10 17:29:42	Ahmeds	I'm looking for something easier
2016-09-10 17:29:50	Ahmeds	what does it mean by string[i] - 'a'
2016-09-10 17:29:53	Ahmeds	why I subtract a
2016-09-10 17:30:46	parsnip	Ahmeds: oh, to number the letters. is that expression in the book?
2016-09-10 17:30:59	parsnip	Ahmeds: http://bradyt.com/posts/2016-07-31-The-ascii-few-know-control-beep-escape/
2016-09-10 17:31:34	parsnip	Ahmeds: letters are represented by integers. 'A' is 65 for instance.
2016-09-10 17:31:36	Ahmeds	no its not in the book
2016-09-10 17:31:52	Ahmeds	parsnip: can you solve hackerrank problems ?
2016-09-10 17:31:54	parsnip	Ahmeds: which language do you use?
2016-09-10 17:32:16	parsnip	Ahmeds: i haven't done many. i've been doing euler problems so far.
2016-09-10 17:32:34	parsnip	'a' is 97
2016-09-10 17:32:58	Ahmeds	I use c++
2016-09-10 17:33:14	parsnip	Ahmeds: so that subtraction looks like it would make 'a' as 0, 'b' as 1, etc.
2016-09-10 17:33:45	parsnip	what language is intro to algos written with? >.<
2016-09-10 17:35:12	Ahmeds	pesudo code
2016-09-10 17:35:17	parsnip	ah, nice
2016-09-10 17:35:20	Ahmeds	horrible code :D
2016-09-10 17:35:58	parsnip	well, i guess one issue i'll have is, many algorithms don't translate to haskell very well :(
2016-09-10 17:36:10	parsnip	maybe i'll have to try python some more
2016-09-10 17:36:49	Ahmeds	yea
2016-09-10 17:36:56	Ahmeds	I don't know why people are silent here
2016-09-10 17:36:57	Ahmeds	:/

2016-09-10 17:37:57	parsnip	i don't think that's how irc works in general.
2016-09-10 17:38:13	Ahmeds	yea correct
2016-09-10 17:38:30	parsnip	Ahmeds: does your irc client allow you to search channel names and topics?

2016-09-10 17:39:32	parsnip	Ahmeds: searching freenode channels names and topics for "algorithm" gives me a few results. ##c++-general has the word algorithm in topic. there's also a #algorithms channel. might find a busier channel to ask if there's a book before intro to algos.
2016-09-10 17:39:59	parsnip	Ahmeds: my irc client runs in a terminal in a remote server, so it's always on ;)
2016-09-10 17:40:17	parsnip	in fact, it's weechat, so it relays to a phone app too :)
2016-09-10 17:41:37	Ahmeds	parsnip: I joined algorithms now
2016-09-10 17:41:42	Ahmeds	they are active
2016-09-10 17:42:12	parsnip	Ahmeds: yeah, my channel search tool orders by number of members by default.
