He licensed "Pick" to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors who have produced different "flavors" of Pick. The database flavors sold by TigerLogic were D3, mvBase, and mvEnterprise. Those previously sold by IBM under the "U2" umbrella are known as UniData and UniVerse. Rocket Software 
2016-06-04 17:34:29	jml2	purchased IBM's U2 family of products in 2010 and TigerLogic's D3 and mvBase family of products in 2014.
