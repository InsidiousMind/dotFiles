2016-05-27 23:31:33	unit73e	crutchy, no I mean that in DB on problem is that NULL doesn't mean the value does not exist
2016-05-27 23:31:37	unit73e	it means that it is unknown
2016-05-27 23:31:41	crutchy	or just enforce a default value

2016-05-27 23:32:22	unit73e	comparisions are a big problem with NULLs for example
2016-05-27 23:32:32	unit73e	NULL does not equal NULL
2016-05-27 23:32:54	unit73e	and why do you use NULLs in DB?
2016-05-27 23:33:01	crutchy	yeah but i mean if you do an insert query and you don't assign one of the fields, what should a select query that returns that record put for that field?

2016-05-27 23:33:24	crutchy	what is nothing?

2016-05-27 23:37:16	unit73e	one other problem is that contraints are duplicated in application code and in the database
2016-05-27 23:37:48	crutchy	yeah the table design is only one piece of the puzzle
2016-05-27 23:38:03	crutchy	there's plenty of shitty db apps
2016-05-27 23:38:08	unit73e	y
2016-05-27 23:38:15	unit73e	databases should only have data
2016-05-27 23:38:18	unit73e	and nothing else

2016-05-27 23:38:39	crutchy	but even how apps access/use the data needs to be accounted for
2016-05-27 23:38:57	crutchy	like, you could elimiate nulls by just making sure insert/update queries assigned all fields
2016-05-27 23:39:15	unit73e	true but the risk is never fully eliminated
2016-05-27 23:39:22	crutchy	yup
2016-05-27 23:39:29	unit73e	it's not an easy problem to fix at all
2016-05-27 23:39:39	unit73e	or someone would have done it already
2016-05-27 23:39:48	crutchy	you can try to make something idiot proof, but nature will always invent a better idiot :p
2016-05-27 23:39:52	unit73e	then there are legacy things like varchar(size)
2016-05-27 23:39:54	unit73e	why size
2016-05-27 23:40:06	unit73e	why not just string
2016-05-27 23:40:17	beaky	to prevent those assholes that plop gigabyte strings :D
2016-05-27 23:40:29	unit73e	yes but the real answer is legacy
2016-05-27 23:40:32	beaky	oh
2016-05-27 23:40:34	beaky	what is legacy
2016-05-27 23:40:39	beaky	the legacy of kain
2016-05-27 23:40:43	unit73e	it's stupid decisions in the past lol
2016-05-27 23:40:47	crutchy	a pain in the leg

2016-05-27 23:41:35	crutchy	hmm. i thought you could use varchar without size?
2016-05-27 23:41:35	unit73e	good game
2016-05-27 23:41:43	crutchy	maybe not. can't remember
2016-05-27 23:41:51	unit73e	you can't but some databases use a different type
2016-05-27 23:41:53	unit73e	like text
2016-05-27 23:41:55	unit73e	or so
2016-05-27 23:42:02	crutchy	ah yeah thats probably what i use
2016-05-27 23:42:26	crutchy	hmm. nope i use things like varchar(255)
2016-05-27 23:42:34	crutchy	i guess that's probably equiv to text
2016-05-27 23:42:45	unit73e	implementation wise it is the same thing
2016-05-27 23:42:50	unit73e	but varchar as a constraint

2016-05-27 23:43:10	unit73e	I thought about other stuff like fix XML (which is stupid)
2016-05-27 23:43:25	unit73e	why have only one root?
2016-05-27 23:43:39	SailorHaumea	hi unit73e o/
2016-05-27 23:43:42	crutchy	didn't they try to fix xml with json?
2016-05-27 23:43:43	unit73e	and what's the problem with a stripped down language like python
2016-05-27 23:43:43	SailorHaumea	hi crutchy o/
2016-05-27 23:43:47	unit73e	hey SailorHaumea 
2016-05-27 23:43:50	crutchy	g'day SailorHaumea o/
2016-05-27 23:44:18	crutchy	python would be better if it didn't have such a restrictive syntax
2016-05-27 23:44:32	pyon	crutchy: JSON and XML are fine data exchange formats, especially for small amounts of data (per individual exchange), but they're horrible as a storage format for data meant to be arbitrarily queried anytime.
2016-05-27 23:44:46	crutchy	pyon, true
2016-05-27 23:44:48	pyon	s/a storage format/storage formats/
2016-05-27 23:44:50	unit73e	sure but the point is that XML contains lots of garbage
2016-05-27 23:45:00	unit73e	and force to have one root
2016-05-27 23:45:09	crutchy	unit73e, xml seems like it was designed merely for web use
2016-05-27 23:45:09	unit73e	awful for config files

2016-05-28 19:01:07	amigojapan	Lightwise: well, there are pros and cons,  but for now hte pros outweigh the cons.... I have been living here for 13 years
2016-05-28 19:01:52	amigojapan	Lightwise: the biggest con is that it is hard to make friends if y ou dont know where to go to meet people.... there is not a culture of talking to strangers
2016-05-28 19:02:04	Lightwise	i can imagine
2016-05-28 19:02:37	Lightwise	is the celibacy syndrome really that bad there?
2016-05-28 19:02:58	amigojapan	Lightwise: but Japan tends to be much safer when ti comes to crime and stuff like that... also a huge pro that keeps me in Japan even now, is that both my wife and I need lots of medical attention, and hte Japanese government covers most of that
2016-05-28 19:03:28	amigojapan	Lightwise: sorry, I am not familliar with that term, what is "celibacy syndrome"?

2016-05-29 15:57:50	Nanobot	You didn't fall in love, your penis rose in horniness
2016-05-29 15:58:40	Nanobot	Kinda like what bitcoin is doing right now
2016-05-29 16:00:14	Nanobot	So now is the point at which the Bitcoin community starts looking for any scraps of anything resembling news so they can attribute the rise to something they can understand, because people have a hard time accepting that the market is largely moved by traders doing normal trading based on technical signals
2016-05-29 16:00:42	Fenderbassist	Nanobot: but...but...but...it isn't magic?   *cries*

2016-05-29 16:03:28	beaky	as badly as i want to meet her
2016-05-29 16:03:29	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: family oriented, I think
2016-05-29 16:03:38	Nanobot	As I mentioned before, there's a $570 resistance line on Bitstamp ($573 on Bitfinex)
2016-05-29 16:03:49	beaky	whats bitstamp
2016-05-29 16:03:54	Fenderbassist	Nanobot: ah sorry I didn't scroll up to catch up

2016-05-29 16:04:52	bagelsan	the thing i dont like about it though is its all a show and so many people like in life are shallow and cold as fuck and overly judgemental
2016-05-29 16:05:00	Fenderbassist	Nanobot: I had a "d'oh" moment, I forgot to scroll up and read
2016-05-29 16:05:24	bagelsan	but if you look past that its kinda fun, i like studying religions
2016-05-29 16:05:27	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: life can feel like that, but there's hope hidden within the cracks
2016-05-29 16:05:56	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: fortunately we don't actually know all the poeple , not even .00001 percent, so there's hope
2016-05-29 16:06:10	Nanobot	Bitfinex is really close to that resistance line. Which means it'll probably do a temporary sharp drop, and the Bitcoin community will start screaming "IT WAS A PUMP AND DUMP" like a bunch of idiots
2016-05-29 16:06:30	bagelsan	i like helping others in real life. random people on here call me a cunt but ive probably done more for the homeless in one year than theyve done for anyone their entire life
2016-05-29 16:06:38	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: once we get past our disappointments and let-downs, we can resume our search
2016-05-29 16:07:00	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, helping people in need is an awesome feeling

2016-05-29 21:27:05	GGLucas	This /ss/ thread made me think. Eventually we're going to get full dive VR. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but it's going to happen eventually. And when it does, just like how I'm sure most of us started watching porn when we were like what, about 11? There's going to be an entire generation of guys who will have started experiencing virtual sex from a very young age.
2016-05-29 21:28:18	Nanobot	They're going to film the loli naked
2016-05-29 21:28:35	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: that's a good question, I've been watching Sword Art Online with that tech and it brought up all sorts of questions for me as well
2016-05-29 21:28:39	GGLucas	Sure the media is going to throw a shitstorm of epic proportions out of it. But it's not like they could keep us from browsing for titties. And then after a generation or two there's going to be this awkward situation where people will start to have to examine age of consent laws.

2016-05-29 21:31:11	GGLucas	Fenderbassist: Right. But I'm more talking about the societal impact on how sex is viewed.
2016-05-29 21:32:07	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: yes, I understood, and I was hinting at possible reaction to it / "business as usual"

2016-06-01 20:38:20	YetiMaster5000	I was being whining and my mother pushed me and I fell into the corner of the table

2016-06-01 20:38:47	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: Good job falling right onto that fucking table
2016-06-01 20:38:57	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: oh wow, she actually pushed you...
2016-06-01 20:38:57	KaffeeJunky123	did your mom give you a good beating for falling that badly?
2016-06-01 20:39:20	KaffeeJunky123	sorry if I hit the nail with that one, domestic violence isn't funny...
2016-06-01 20:39:21	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: is she normally violent?
2016-06-01 20:39:36	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: I bet he just clinged to her like all little boys do
2016-06-01 20:39:46	KaffeeJunky123	whilst she was doing something
2016-06-01 20:39:52	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: I call accident
2016-06-01 20:40:05	YetiMaster5000	I'm not a boy KaffeeJunky123. And no, we've never got along. 
2016-06-01 20:40:12	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: Oh right
2016-06-01 20:40:13	KaffeeJunky123	I remember
2016-06-01 20:40:16	KaffeeJunky123	You're a girl
2016-06-01 20:40:41	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: you didn't deserve that, I'm sad she mistreated you like that
2016-06-01 20:40:42	KaffeeJunky123	did she apologize later?
2016-06-01 20:41:40	YetiMaster5000	Nah
2016-06-01 20:41:49	Myrl-saki	]seen kosan

But it seems it redirects to kat.cr now, which leads me to believe there's a reason they aren't using kickass.to anymore. Might have a malicious site round-robbin'd in? Anyways. Use the shorter one.

2016-06-01 20:43:52	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: I suppose you saw a doctor shortly after?

2016-06-01 20:44:14	Myrl-saki	kosan: \o
2016-06-01 20:44:57	YetiMaster5000	Had to stay in the hospital for like 6 days

2016-06-01 20:45:22	YetiMaster5000	Was swelling weird or something. Don't really remember tbh
2016-06-01 20:45:40	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: you fully recovered?
2016-06-01 20:46:03	YetiMaster5000	As far as I'm aware XD
2016-06-01 20:46:22	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: good :)
2016-06-01 20:46:36	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: did you get your new card?
2016-06-01 20:46:40	YetiMaster5000	I was a dumbass for like a month and couldn't go to work full time because staring at the computer made me sick
2016-06-01 20:46:56	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: well you were recovering from a serious injury
2016-06-01 20:47:11	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: and it wasn't your fault
2016-06-01 20:47:58	YetiMaster5000	What new card are you talking about?
2016-06-01 20:48:17	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: credit card
2016-06-01 20:48:24	KaffeeJunky123	so
2016-06-01 20:48:33	KaffeeJunky123	I've tried to apply for an amazon debit card
2016-06-01 20:48:37	KaffeeJunky123	they won't give me one!
2016-06-01 20:48:47	KaffeeJunky123	I only wanted it because of the amazon discount
2016-06-01 20:48:48	YetiMaster5000	Yeah, Fenderbassist 
2016-06-01 20:48:53	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: k cool
2016-06-01 20:49:05	YetiMaster5000	It's a stupid chip card 
2016-06-01 20:49:11	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: what's your monthly wage?
2016-06-01 20:49:13	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: remember to only spend to the point that you can pay balance in full each month to avoid interest
2016-06-01 20:49:14	YetiMaster5000	I don't like those things 
2016-06-01 20:49:19	KaffeeJunky123	no NFC?
2016-06-01 20:49:21	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: they're all going that route
2016-06-01 20:49:33	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: Amazon is pretty strict with their cards
2016-06-01 20:49:34	YetiMaster5000	I get 1.5% back on everything, Fenderbassist 
2016-06-01 20:49:41	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: cool :)
2016-06-01 20:49:49	YetiMaster5000	Gonna spend the full limit on it every month to maximize cash back
2016-06-01 20:49:59	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: dunno about that, their intrest rate is much higher than the one of my bankaccount
2016-06-01 20:50:09	KaffeeJunky123	and their fees are rather high
2016-06-01 20:50:23	KaffeeJunky123	I should just get one from my local bank instead
2016-06-01 20:50:31	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: yes it's an impulse buy card, not a good deal
2016-06-01 20:50:33	KaffeeJunky123	They offer a free pay only visa card
2016-06-01 20:50:39	YetiMaster5000	Like 3400 before deductions KaffeeJunky123 
2016-06-01 20:50:41	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: and because millions use Amazon they ahve to be strict
2016-06-01 20:50:44	YetiMaster5000	$3400
2016-06-01 20:50:58	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: no wonder you got a card without troubles
2016-06-01 20:51:07	YetiMaster5000	Maybe like $3450
2016-06-01 20:51:08	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: you can get much better deal from regular banks
2016-06-01 20:51:15	YetiMaster5000	Too sleepy for math 
2016-06-01 20:51:26	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: I don't even need the stupid debit feature
2016-06-01 20:51:38	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: no annual fee, 20ish percent interest, no bs setup fee or such
2016-06-01 20:51:56	YetiMaster5000	And money back
2016-06-01 20:51:58	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: interests are much lower here 
2016-06-01 20:52:05	YetiMaster5000	And like $150 for spending 500
2016-06-01 20:52:08	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: good
2016-06-01 20:52:13	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: interest is a killer
2016-06-01 20:52:27	KaffeeJunky123	Well, I'd never intent to get there
2016-06-01 20:52:28	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: it's wasted money when you're not buying a really expensive thing
2016-06-01 20:53:03	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: I only need it because google and amazon web services still requipre debit cards 
2016-06-01 20:53:11	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: the whole idea is to pay your balances off so that your rating goes up fast, so that when the day comes you need to buy a house or expensive car...you can get line of credit with lower rate
2016-06-01 20:53:15	KaffeeJunky123	even for free tier dev accounts
2016-06-01 20:53:16	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: ah I see
2016-06-01 20:53:31	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: can't you just get regular debit card attached to checking account?
2016-06-01 20:53:41	KaffeeJunky123	I can
2016-06-01 20:53:45	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: that's what I use
2016-06-01 20:53:57	KaffeeJunky123	but I'd have to make an appointment at the bank
2016-06-01 20:53:59	KaffeeJunky123	and leave the house
2016-06-01 20:54:00	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: I always stay within my means that way
2016-06-01 20:54:02	KaffeeJunky123	and all
2016-06-01 20:54:12	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: yeah, it's worth it imho
2016-06-01 20:54:19	KaffeeJunky123	dunno
2016-06-01 20:54:28	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: something to consider anyway
2016-06-01 20:54:45	YetiMaster5000	I needed a credit card to build credit though 
2016-06-01 20:54:49	KaffeeJunky123	getting there by public transportation costs me 4.2€ on its own
2016-06-01 20:55:04	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: Heh
2016-06-01 20:55:06	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: yep, and you're doing well I think
2016-06-01 20:55:12	KaffeeJunky123	Strange stuff
2016-06-01 20:55:13	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: ah I see
2016-06-01 20:55:15	YetiMaster5000	Dani has no credit and mine is only okay. Gonna be boned when we try to buy a house someday 
2016-06-01 20:55:27	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: nah, you'll build credit rating
2016-06-01 20:55:44	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: pretty fast as long as you don't leave a constant revolving balance
2016-06-01 20:55:49	KaffeeJunky123	So you need to have a debit card in them usa?
2016-06-01 20:55:59	KaffeeJunky123	or otherwise you won't get no affordable loan later on?
2016-06-01 20:56:04	KaffeeJunky123	heh
2016-06-01 20:56:15	KaffeeJunky123	For that reason I don't like loans
2016-06-01 20:56:17	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: it's very helpful to have one, you still use credit cards or loans to build credit
2016-06-01 20:56:23	YetiMaster5000	You need to borrow money to get cheaper loans later 
2016-06-01 20:56:25	koromo	I have to go out. Arigatou gozaimashita and mata yoroshiku onegaisimasu.

2016-06-01 20:56:47	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: I guess it works the same here
2016-06-01 20:56:57	KaffeeJunky123	but it's also based on income and running credits
2016-06-01 20:56:58	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: exactly, plus you need to pay bills always on time (early is better)
2016-06-01 20:57:10	KaffeeJunky123	so a ton of open credits would lower your score

2016-06-01 20:57:44	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: it's a little bit different here
2016-06-01 20:57:46	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: they want to see money control :)

2016-06-01 21:01:06	KaffeeJunky123	well, the people who collect the money do notify schufa
2016-06-01 21:01:15	KaffeeJunky123	and that'll result in a negative score for you

2016-06-01 21:07:37	KaffeeJunky123	It also means there's lot less venture capital
2016-06-01 21:07:44	KaffeeJunky123	So loans for business get more expensive
2016-06-01 21:07:54	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: I can see that being the case

2016-06-02 07:12:32	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: of course...the variations of that old joke include a woman on a worker baseball team saying: (Mimi Bobeck) I protect home plate, like a Mormon girl on prom night.
2016-06-02 07:12:50	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: and dozens others
2016-06-02 07:13:20	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: anyway, I can see that it went down very poorly with anime fans all over, so bad on then

2016-06-02 07:39:56	mathu	Illya: aren't you yourself 15-17
2016-06-02 07:39:56	YetiMaster5000	Nah ezekielnoob2. He's a young person
2016-06-02 07:39:59	Avonis	18-25, the pinnacle of youth
2016-06-02 07:40:01	YetiMaster5000	He wants somebody his own age.
2016-06-02 07:40:10	Avonis	what's young is thy spirit 
2016-06-02 07:40:14	Avonis	ayy I'm getting deep
2016-06-02 07:40:41	pyon	ezekielnoob2: I prefer 16. It's not only a square, but also a fourth power.

2016-06-02 07:40:49	mathu	can't find the specific chart i saw with both men and women plotted, but here's an article about what i assume is the same data set http://jezebel.com/mens-favorite-ages-are-20-21-22-and-23-a-data-dive-1731660984

2016-06-02 07:40:56	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: Bruce Lee, who was the concept giver (imho, it's still debated) for the show (his original title being "The Warrior") was a Gung Fu practicioner and degree holder in Philosophy

2016-06-02 07:42:14	Illya	pyon: probably learning more towards 17

2016-06-02 07:43:07	pyon	YetiMaster5000: What do you mean by “you're a bad”?
2016-06-02 07:43:13	mathu	pyon: is 16 not legal in peru? i thought sex laws were more lax in south america than they are here
2016-06-02 07:43:17	YetiMaster5000	It means that you are a bad.

2016-06-02 07:44:39	pyon	mathu: Supposedly the age of consent here is 14, but I'm not sure if that means only “sex between two people aged 14-17 is okay”, or also “sex between an adult person and another person aged 14-17 is okay”..
2016-06-02 07:44:40	Myrl-saki	Avonis: You even got it wrong.
2016-06-02 07:44:45	Myrl-saki	Avonis: 3 + 5 = 7. great.

2016-06-02 07:45:25	YetiMaster5000	Age of consent in Oklahoma is 14 if the other person is 16 I think
2016-06-02 07:45:33	Avonis	Myrl-saki, doood I love you :p
2016-06-02 07:45:41	YetiMaster5000	The actual age of consent is 16 but it can have a two year gap
2016-06-02 07:45:46	mathu	pyon: i'm not clear on it either, but idk i don't need to get with 17yos so that's fine haha
2016-06-02 07:45:47	YetiMaster5000	I think 18 year olds can do stuff with 16 year olds
2016-06-02 07:45:56	YetiMaster5000	and 16 year olds can do stuff with 14 year olds
2016-06-02 07:45:59	Avonis	so you can actually have sex with a 14yo ?
2016-06-02 07:46:04	YetiMaster5000	If you're 16

2016-06-02 07:46:25	mathu	pyon: oh i know, i think you'd find youths insufferable haha
2016-06-02 07:46:28	Avonis	but then I guess kids look mature over there lmao
2016-06-02 07:46:33	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: oh yes, they had all sorts of technical advisors come in when they dropped Bruce Lee out of the idea and brought in others
2016-06-02 07:46:35	Myrl-saki	mathu: You mean romeo juliet law?

2016-06-02 07:47:36	mathu	so talking about age of consent in this channel often winds up a shitshow
2016-06-02 07:47:41	mathu	i wonder if this was a mistake lol
2016-06-02 07:47:41	exiff	Nothing ever works well when you try to apply concrete laws to something as fuzzy as mental sexual maturity.
2016-06-02 07:47:42	Avonis	mathu, MAN
2016-06-02 07:47:45	mathu	at least taylanub is banned
2016-06-02 07:47:50	amigojapan	ok Fenderbassist 
2016-06-02 07:47:50	YetiMaster5000	"In Oklahoma, the age of consent is 16, and the law recognizes an age differential of two years. This means that no person can be convicted of rape or rape by instrumentation with anyone over the age of 14, with that person’s consent, unless the defendant was older than 18 at the time the sexual act occurred."
2016-06-02 07:47:52	Myrl-saki	mathu: Wait, what? tayla's banned?

2016-06-02 07:50:56	Myrl-saki	I feel like 50 years old shouldn't be in jail just because they do it with a 16 yo. :(
2016-06-02 07:50:58	theholyduck	or whatever its called
2016-06-02 07:51:13	theholyduck	norway also has the judicial discretional option of
2016-06-02 07:51:15	theholyduck	"mental equals"
2016-06-02 07:51:34	theholyduck	where a judge can use common sense instead of the letterof the laws
2016-06-02 07:51:36	pyon	Myrl-saki: Dunno. When I was 16yo, I found that extremely creepy, but now that I'm older, I'm starting to reconsider it. Why? :-p
2016-06-02 07:51:48	theholyduck	Myrl-saki: in norway they wouldnt be
2016-06-02 07:51:49	YetiMaster5000	Because you're a perv
2016-06-02 07:51:51	Myrl-saki	What if it's true love?
2016-06-02 07:52:00	mathu	pyon: it got to a point where he was just repeating his views instead of arguing properly and he would say shit like "yes because i am above thinking about what i say"
2016-06-02 07:52:10	theholyduck	in norway 16  is the "sexual self decision age" 
2016-06-02 07:52:13	Myrl-saki	Clearly, we need to research on the idea of love.
2016-06-02 07:52:23	mathu	pyon: paraphrased, i don't remember what he *actually* said, but he was bein a huge persistent vitriolic shit

2016-06-02 07:52:33	Myrl-saki	theholyduck: When's the "sexual others decision age"?
2016-06-02 07:52:47	theholyduck	Myrl-saki: wat?
2016-06-02 07:52:53	theholyduck	like a when is it ok to rape someboody age?
2016-06-02 07:52:55	Myrl-saki	theholyduck: dunno
2016-06-02 07:52:58	theholyduck	i dont think that age exists
2016-06-02 07:53:18	Myrl-saki	We don't use the word "rape" around here
2016-06-02 07:53:46	pyon	mathu: Ah. :-|
2016-06-02 07:54:04	amigojapan	Fenderbassist: dont bother, this documentary is good enough
2016-06-02 07:54:13	mathu	34 weeks sounds like it's more recent than i'm remembering. maybe he just left?
2016-06-02 07:54:15	YetiMaster5000	What word do you use, Myrl-saki?
2016-06-02 07:54:19	YetiMaster5000	Struggle-snuggle?
2016-06-02 07:54:22	pyon	Myrl-saki: A 16yo can't possibly feel “true (romantic) love” for anyone.
2016-06-02 07:54:44	theholyduck	pyon: meh like thats a requirement for anything
2016-06-02 07:54:49	theholyduck	even if that was true

2016-06-02 07:55:18	amigojapan	ok, thanks Fenderbassist :)
2016-06-02 07:55:20	theholyduck	i dont necesarily think "true love" is a thing. 
2016-06-02 07:55:21	mathu	nah looks like taylanub wasn't banned
2016-06-02 07:55:23	pyon	theholyduck: I'm just saying that Myrl's specific argument for a 50yo and a 16yo having sex doesn't hold water.
2016-06-02 07:55:25	mathu	or was unbanned at least
2016-06-02 07:55:26	mathu	huh
2016-06-02 07:55:33	theholyduck	pyon: my specific argument is
2016-06-02 07:55:42	theholyduck	16 is old enough to decide if you want to have sex with somebody
2016-06-02 07:55:55	pyon	theholyduck: Sure.
2016-06-02 07:56:05	mathu	,yt tim minchin if i didn't have you
2016-06-02 07:56:24	mathu	god those commands were useful
2016-06-02 07:56:34	mathu	i liked them more than i like half the users here
2016-06-02 07:56:34	pyon	theholyduck: And even if it isn't old enough, at some point, the only way people can learn is by trying and making mistakes. :-p
2016-06-02 07:56:36	theholyduck	mathu: we could have them back :D
2016-06-02 07:56:52	mathu	theholyduck: people would bitch if they saw a certain someone using them again
2016-06-02 07:57:04	mathu	despite those invocations being ~5% of what he said (i literally calculated that)
2016-06-02 07:57:19	theholyduck	pyon: well theres a certain age where people are more gullible. 
2016-06-02 07:57:26	theholyduck	ofcourse adults dont have to pass a guilibility test
2016-06-02 07:57:28	theholyduck	to be allowed to fuck
2016-06-02 07:58:00	theholyduck	but still the idea atleast is that at some point you arent old enough to understand whats going on. and so by definition cant consent to it
2016-06-02 07:58:09	theholyduck	where you draw that line is entirely arbitrary though
2016-06-02 07:58:21	pyon	theholyduck: Not arbitrary. Just fuzzy.
2016-06-02 07:58:25	theholyduck	and it would depend on the people in question which is why norway has a "mental equals opition"
2016-06-02 07:58:36	exiff	I think I've said this before... It used to be parents that mitigated the "grey-zone"... i.e. your pa would shoot anyone who came close to him young daughter
2016-06-02 07:58:49	exiff	Now, we have the nanny-state
2016-06-02 07:58:59	theholyduck	like if the lovers convince the police/judge that on this matter they are mental equals
2016-06-02 07:59:01	theholyduck	then its ok :P 
2016-06-02 07:59:12	mathu	exiff: do we have to get into why personal, subjective vigilante justice is not a great system
2016-06-02 07:59:30	theholyduck	i.e a 15 year old and a 18 year old could in theory have sex in norway and not legally be in trouble because theres judicial discretion involved
2016-06-02 07:59:35	theholyduck	even if the law says 16
2016-06-02 08:00:03	exiff	personal, subjective vigilante justice? I'm talking about parent's protection instincts here.
2016-06-02 08:00:18	pyon	theholyduck: That only works to the extent judges have common sense.
2016-06-02 08:00:31	theholyduck	pyon: well if they dont
2016-06-02 08:00:38	theholyduck	theres still the 16 hard line
2016-06-02 08:00:56	theholyduck	and judges are SUPPOSED to exercise judicial discretion thats why you HAVE judges

2016-06-02 08:01:37	theholyduck	ofcourse american judges are mostly elected. rather than apointed for competence.

2016-06-02 08:03:00	pyon	Here, the judge's job is to creatively interpret the law according to the convenience of whichever party paid the highest bribe.

2016-06-02 08:06:23	mathu	pyon: i feel like child-support-type shit would get less deep as time passes because it's just kinda normal for you after a while
2016-06-02 08:06:29	exiff	We're supposed to have children at a young age anyway.

2016-06-02 08:07:54	exiff	Now poor little mini-pyon must grow up in a broken home.
2016-06-02 08:08:20	mathu	exiff: is it better for a kid to grow up with two parents who fight and don't love them?
2016-06-02 08:08:48	exiff	not "don't love them"... "don't love each other"
2016-06-02 08:09:01	mathu	exiff: plenty of parents don't love their kids

2016-06-02 08:09:46	mathu	exiff: what does that mean to you?
2016-06-02 08:10:16	exiff	generaly,raising your child to be an independent adult.
2016-06-02 08:11:19	mathu	exiff: kids i know who were raised by single parents or working parents are actually generally more independent than me and others who had a stay-at-home mom haha
2016-06-02 08:11:24	mathu	exiff: anecdotal, but
2016-06-02 08:11:28	exiff	It should be an exception for kids to grow up without their parents (and by this I also mean parents who only pay child support)... not the norm
2016-06-02 08:11:40	mathu	exiff: i don't think it's close to the norm

2016-06-02 08:13:41	mathu	i've had a lot of e-fights where, like, people say you should just tolerate spousal abuse because that is somehow less broken than a single-parent home
2016-06-02 08:13:48	exiff	The high number of unmarried parent and divorce in society makes it high
2016-06-02 08:13:48	exiff	I mean, single parenthood was a taboo for a reason.
2016-06-02 08:14:09	mathu	this is something that has been researched before
2016-06-02 08:14:23	mathu	if i weren't waiting for a build to finish i'd probably google around
2016-06-02 08:14:29	exiff	Those are extreme cases... It should not be a problem if you solve the abuse element in the relationship/
2016-06-02 08:14:36	mathu	easier said than done
2016-06-02 08:14:44	exiff	But well worth doing.
2016-06-02 08:15:01	exiff	And again, classical traditions offer remedies for stuff like that.
2016-06-02 08:15:20	mathu	additionally sometimes there is no relationship, there's just sex and then pregnancy

2016-06-02 09:06:36	Illya	I said speak clearer english because I didnt understand it
2016-06-02 09:07:07	elusiveother	Illya, are you sure that's not due to a defect in the listener?
2016-06-02 09:07:20	elusiveother	i mean, you can't really blame the speaker for his audience being deaf

2016-06-02 09:09:07	Illya	elusiveother: no, you'd use fucking sign language... because that's what they understand, and it's extremely likely that a speaker, who was going to speak to a deaf person, knows sign language.
2016-06-02 09:09:44	elusiveother	Illya, i can't use sign language to everyone before i know they're afflicted with a condition that presents itself minimally in the general population

2016-06-02 09:10:06	elusiveother	Illya, also, i don't use sign language, so upon learning, i'd either play charades or find someone who does

2016-06-02 09:12:47	elusiveother	davic, have i been insulting them?
2016-06-02 09:12:52	YetiMaster5000	If it's a one syllable word you're supposed to add "er" and "est" to the end of them.
2016-06-02 09:12:56	davic	elusiveother: you compared him to a deaf person

2016-06-02 09:14:56	YetiMaster5000	Because they can read lips?
2016-06-02 09:14:58	Illya	it doesnt take long?
2016-06-02 09:15:17	elusiveother	Illya, incorrect. they cater to an ever changing language wherein once it was structured and reasonable, but it's become destroyed by people who think "clearer" is a word

2016-06-02 09:15:36	elusiveother	Illya, this is the first time you've told me you're deaf

2016-06-02 09:16:10	Illya	well, american english != british english
2016-06-02 09:16:17	Illya	both are english
2016-06-02 09:16:23	pyon	elusiveother: “who think "clearer" is a word” --> Well, what is, according to you, the comparative form of the adjective “clear”?
2016-06-02 09:16:24	Illya	clearer is a word in british english
2016-06-02 09:16:35	davic	amigojapan: "fuck" isn't as bad as you think, people use it every fucking day in this channel in various sentences. Words like "cunt" etc though shouldn't be allowed
2016-06-02 09:16:38	elusiveother	Illya, the rules hardly change and british english is more decayed than the other
2016-06-02 09:16:41	davic	but "fuck" is a common word... everywhere
2016-06-02 09:16:50	YetiMaster5000	It's a word in American English too, Illya

2016-06-02 09:16:57	nexia	adyrhan_, meh, only finally switched to a more stable area like 2-3 days ago 
2016-06-02 09:16:59	nexia	still getting used to
2016-06-02 09:17:04	elusiveother	Illya, look up the difference between device and devise
2016-06-02 09:17:07	YetiMaster5000	One syllable superlative adjectives add "er" to the end when becoming comparative.
2016-06-02 09:17:10	YetiMaster5000	It's in the rules
2016-06-02 09:17:11	pyon	nexia: Where you been?

2016-06-02 09:19:34	elusiveother	they do; however, evolution that is not beneficial to the language must be snuffed out
2016-06-02 09:19:57	davic	so..
2016-06-02 09:19:59	colel	Such as "clearer"?
2016-06-02 09:19:59	Illya	who said evolution was beneficial, or had to be so?
2016-06-02 09:20:09	elusiveother	just as animals who adapt to a condition in a poor manner don't live very long
2016-06-02 09:20:10	Illya	and clearer is definitely a word

2016-06-02 09:21:05	Illya	elusiveother: if you're willing to accept that people will occasionally tell you it's a word, that's all well and good
2016-06-02 09:21:10	elusiveother	HeTo, according to Korea, yes

2016-06-02 09:21:41	Illya	what the fuck is your problem
2016-06-02 09:21:51	Illya	seriously
2016-06-02 09:21:53	HeTo	I think the direction of change has been that "more" is becoming used to form comparatives more often and -er less often
2016-06-02 09:21:57	nexia	Adyrhan, bigger is more precision
2016-06-02 09:22:18	nexia	smaller is easier jumps at the cost of that, idk

2016-06-02 09:24:26	Illya	elusiveother: you still said his previous nick

2016-06-02 12:42:09	Urchin	kazumi-kun: there's more in depth stuff about individual characters that don't get much screen time in the anime

2016-06-02 12:54:16	Urchin	doesn't look too interesting
2016-06-02 12:54:33	kazumi-kun	I strangely liked the Devil May Cry anime 
2016-06-02 12:54:37	kazumi-kun	got it on DVD
2016-06-02 12:54:41	Urchin	sure, everybody has a show or two they like that isn't very good
2016-06-02 12:54:55	Urchin	that one was pretty good
2016-06-02 12:55:04	Shinra	I like 20 in my case =D
2016-06-02 12:55:04	kazumi-kun	Wish it was longer :(
2016-06-02 12:55:20	Faika	Hey, Shinra corporation.
2016-06-02 12:55:23	kazumi-kun	holy shit is #anime actually sustaining a chat about anime :O
2016-06-02 12:55:28	Urchin	I really liked the original Hellsing TV show for the dub
2016-06-02 12:55:32	Shinra	hello
2016-06-02 12:55:32	Faika	Honestly if they were a real life organization I would work for them.
2016-06-02 12:55:49	Faika	For the materia.
2016-06-02 12:56:00	kazumi-kun	Urchin oh shit I was suppose to watch Hellsing it was on my to watch list ages ago but forgot
2016-06-02 12:56:26	Faika	I don't remember, but did the Turks ever have any materia, Shinra?
2016-06-02 12:56:35	Faika	I could of sworn they didn't in FF7
2016-06-02 12:56:48	Urchin	I really like the dub of that version
2016-06-02 12:56:50	kazumi-kun	Turks were all muscle 
2016-06-02 12:56:58	Urchin	to the point I like it better than the OVA
2016-06-02 12:57:00	Shinra	They, like most enemies, had their unique abilities
2016-06-02 12:57:07	Shinra	in place of regular magic
2016-06-02 12:57:23	Shinra	like the electrocution thing Reno did
2016-06-02 12:57:24	Faika	In Crisis Core genesis used materia
2016-06-02 12:57:27	kazumi-kun	like the totally normal human ability to punch through walls and stuff :P
2016-06-02 12:57:31	Sasazuka	Faika: pretty sure they do
2016-06-02 12:57:35	Faika	I guess it was a SOLDIER thing.
2016-06-02 12:57:46	kazumi-kun	I though Advent Children was a pretty good film 
2016-06-02 12:57:52	Faika	No spoil
2016-06-02 12:57:52	YetiMaster5000	I saw advent children.
2016-06-02 12:57:56	YetiMaster5000	That's the only one I've seen
2016-06-02 12:57:57	Faika	Haven't seen it.
2016-06-02 12:58:01	Shinra	Most of that was not conceived at the time of FFVIIs making though
2016-06-02 12:58:07	Faika	I want to finish Crisis Core First
2016-06-02 12:58:13	YetiMaster5000	It was funny when they were fighting in that church building and then their phone rings with the battle end song
2016-06-02 12:58:19	Sasazuka	I don't think there was any requirement for using materia
2016-06-02 12:58:37	⚡	Urchin was never into FF
2016-06-02 12:58:41	kazumi-kun	hahaha YetiMaster5000 forgot about that was amazing the victory tone 
2016-06-02 12:58:47	Shinra	the requirement is just to have something you can equip the materia in to
2016-06-02 12:58:52	YetiMaster5000	Yeah
2016-06-02 12:58:53	Faika	Oh, are you guys talking about the victory fanfare?
2016-06-02 12:58:59	YetiMaster5000	IT's like the one thing I remember from the movie
2016-06-02 12:59:01	YetiMaster5000	Yeah Faika 
2016-06-02 12:59:03	Faika	Dun-dun-dun-duuunnnn-dunnnn-dun-dun-dunnnnnnnnnn
2016-06-02 12:59:22	YetiMaster5000	I think like tifa and yuna were fighting somebody and they won temporarily and their phone rang and it was that song
2016-06-02 12:59:32	Faika	Yuna is from FFX, yo.
2016-06-02 12:59:36	Shinra	Squares games are a lot better than their movies :)
2016-06-02 12:59:56	Faika	Yeah, Chrono Trigger was great too.
2016-06-02 12:59:56	YetiMaster5000	I don't remember the namessss

2016-06-02 13:16:06	YetiMaster5000	will never play it again
2016-06-02 13:16:11	Shinra	same
2016-06-02 13:16:13	Faika	Ya, FF13 had a lot of detail.
2016-06-02 13:16:20	Faika	And it's linear.
2016-06-02 13:16:21	YetiMaster5000	I just remember that the dude had a little baby chocobo in his hair

2016-06-02 13:16:43	Faika	You think FF8 was the best?
2016-06-02 13:16:49	Faika	You even like the way abilities work?
2016-06-02 13:17:04	Shinra	It's kind of widely accepted for 13 having the worst exploration, story and battle system :|
2016-06-02 13:17:11	Faika	FF8 has the most complicated ability system ever.

2016-06-02 13:17:12	Shinra	Yeah I loved everything about 8
2016-06-02 13:17:19	Shinra	It was simple
2016-06-02 13:17:24	Faika	I would spend 20 mins junctioning.
2016-06-02 13:17:29	Illya	Myrl-saki: rly?
2016-06-02 13:17:51	Faika	I tried to assign GFs so that every body 
2016-06-02 13:17:56	Faika	Had every ability
2016-06-02 13:17:59	Faika	You know what I mean?
2016-06-02 13:18:12	Shinra	That'd be very time consuming
2016-06-02 13:18:14	Faika	And then I would farm magic.
2016-06-02 13:18:21	Faika	So I could max stats.
2016-06-02 13:18:25	Shinra	The game is designed to be easy enough to not need to do that
2016-06-02 13:18:30	YetiMaster5000	I think 12 had a weird battle system
2016-06-02 13:18:30	Faika	Then at that point
2016-06-02 13:18:33	Faika	Squall is broken
2016-06-02 13:18:39	YetiMaster5000	With the lines above your head
2016-06-02 13:18:43	YetiMaster5000	Pointing at the enemy
2016-06-02 13:18:44	Faika	With his always criting attacks.

2016-06-02 13:19:05	Faika	FF8 was also slow
2016-06-02 13:19:23	Shinra	the old battle systems of 10 and earlier worked well I think
2016-06-02 13:19:35	Faika	FF10 had the best battle system
2016-06-02 13:19:37	Faika	Imo
2016-06-02 13:19:46	Faika	Cause it's the only one you can change characters.
2016-06-02 13:19:49	Faika	During battle.
2016-06-02 13:20:17	Shinra	if we're talking about post-10 I prefer the systems of Crisis Core, Type-0 and XV
2016-06-02 13:20:21	Faika	Well technically ff6 does it too.

2016-06-02 13:20:47	Shinra	Except I don't like disney :)
2016-06-02 13:21:06	YetiMaster5000	I like 6 fighting style
2016-06-02 13:21:11	YetiMaster5000	Turn based but also speed based
2016-06-02 13:21:27	YetiMaster5000	Plus for sabin you had to input the combos for different blitz abilities
2016-06-02 13:21:29	YetiMaster5000	It was funnnnn
2016-06-02 13:22:55	Faika	Yu do that in FF8
2016-06-02 13:23:03	Faika	Zell and Sabin are similar characters.
2016-06-02 13:23:11	Faika	I didn't like how FF8 weapons worked either.
2016-06-02 13:23:22	Faika	You didn't collect them, you had to remodel your current weapon.
2016-06-02 13:23:35	Faika	And then you don't buy it either, you had to find parts from enemies.
2016-06-02 13:23:47	Shinra	I like that it was different like that
2016-06-02 13:23:49	Faika	Plus the game gives you money without having to fight.
2016-06-02 13:24:22	Faika	My favorite character was Edgar.
2016-06-02 13:24:29	Faika	I thought his bow was OP
2016-06-02 13:24:33	Faika	And his horn.
2016-06-02 13:24:51	Shinra	horny
2016-06-02 13:24:59	Faika	I mean that instrument he uses
2016-06-02 13:25:02	Faika	To confuse enemies
2016-06-02 13:25:52	Shinra	FF fans have their own preferences, it's all good
2016-06-02 13:28:02	Faika	you only like ff6 cause it's your first?
2016-06-02 13:28:26	Shinra	I haven't mentioned 6 ._.
2016-06-02 13:28:47	Faika	I meant Yeti
2016-06-02 13:28:55	Shinra	7 was mine :)
2016-06-02 13:29:31	Sasazuka	7 and Tactics were my favorite
2016-06-02 13:29:47	Sasazuka	and coincidentally the only ones I've beaten
2016-06-02 13:29:54	Faika	I love Tactics too, frustrating game.
2016-06-02 13:30:15	Sasazuka	overleveling made the main story easy
2016-06-02 13:30:29	YetiMaster5000	Dunno Faika 
2016-06-02 13:30:31	Sasazuka	well the random encounters too

2016-06-02 16:35:19	nerdshark	i don't want to work with weebs
2016-06-02 16:35:25	Zachary_DuBois	lol
2016-06-02 16:35:51	nexia	so having an interest in anime, manga and japanese culture is suddenly weeb

2016-06-02 16:37:13	nexia	yes but what makes you think people with those interests listed would do that?
2016-06-02 16:37:13	nerdshark	yes they do

2016-06-02 16:37:37	Sasazuka	nerdshark: ok, I haven't seen one at my workplace
2016-06-02 16:37:47	nexia	nerdshark, no you can't, what sort of perception driven nonsense is that
2016-06-02 16:37:52	nexia	Weaboo is an ambigious shit term that originates from 4chan anyway
2016-06-02 16:37:57	Zachary_DuBois	nerdshark: My local sheriffs department didn't seem to care, nor did the physical security company I applied to
2016-06-02 16:37:57	nerdshark	nexia: you're a fucking teenager
2016-06-02 16:37:59	nerdshark	whatdo you know

2016-06-02 16:38:12	Zachary_DuBois	And I was hired
2016-06-02 16:38:13	Illya	whatdo you know

2016-06-02 16:39:17	nexia	nice sidetracking try, not really
2016-06-02 16:39:23	nerdshark	uh, yes  really
2016-06-02 16:39:24	Sasazuka	I'd say in technical fields, your technical skills matter more
2016-06-02 16:39:33	nerdshark	technical skills  are important
2016-06-02 16:39:44	beaky	meandmytea.blogspot.com/2009/09/know-your-mushi.html
2016-06-02 16:39:44	nexia	i'm sorry about your experience, it sounds like your perceptions are out of line with reality
2016-06-02 16:39:44	nerdshark	but social skills are, quite honestly, just as important
2016-06-02 16:39:48	colel	I do have a legitimate question: Is watching an anime subtitled better than watching the English/your native language voice acted version?
2016-06-02 16:39:50	Sasazuka	and how well you fit into the culture of the company
2016-06-02 16:39:55	beaky	i love mushishi
2016-06-02 16:39:59	beaky	colel: depends
2016-06-02 16:40:03	Sasazuka	generally most culture don't care about your personal interest that much
2016-06-02 16:40:06	Terminus-	urgh... great. i didn't know signing up for AWS isn't instant.
2016-06-02 16:40:06	nexia	dismissing someone who lists those interests sounds dumb
2016-06-02 16:40:09	beaky	on how good the subtitles are
2016-06-02 16:40:09	Sasazuka	*company culture
2016-06-02 16:40:13	beaky	and how good the dubbing is
2016-06-02 16:40:19	Zachary_DuBois	When hiring someone, I couldn't  care less about what their interested in. As long as their interested in the field of work, the job they are applying for, and they actually do shit
2016-06-02 16:40:23	nerdshark	nexia: they don't belong on a professional resume
2016-06-02 16:40:24	nerdshark	period

2016-06-02 16:40:30	nexia	Zachary_DuBois, yep.
2016-06-02 16:40:34	Zachary_DuBois	Other than that, your interests would not impact a company 
2016-06-02 16:40:36	Dhs92	warsh is a very aggressive person. He/She attacked others 97 times.
2016-06-02 16:40:36	Dhs92	For example, like this:
2016-06-02 16:40:36	Dhs92	     * warsh slaps nexia around a bit with a large trout 
2016-06-02 16:40:36	Dhs92	Nexia can't control his/her aggressions, either. He/She picked on others 75 times.
2016-06-02 16:40:38	Dhs92	ಠ_ಠ
2016-06-02 16:40:39	colel	More specifically: In terms of storyline perception/accuracy?
2016-06-02 16:40:51	colel	I realize personally it's a matter of opinion.
2016-06-02 16:41:01	colel	I prefer "dubs" simply for ease of watching
2016-06-02 16:41:02	nexia	nerdshark: if you can list other interests, I don't see what's particularly wrong with listing an interest in an entertainment medium lol
2016-06-02 16:41:07	Zachary_DuBois	Dhs92: What do you want as your primary nick
2016-06-02 16:41:15	Dhs92	Dhs92 is fine
2016-06-02 16:41:19	Zachary_DuBois	Kk
2016-06-02 16:41:20	Illya	nerdshark: I doubt Zachary_DuBois was applying for a corporate
2016-06-02 16:41:30	nerdshark	nexia: you list professional interests
2016-06-02 16:41:34	nexia	my main is nexia, second one is elsah
2016-06-02 16:41:36	nerdshark	things related to the industry you work in
2016-06-02 16:41:39	Illya	Dhs92: bbbb-but yukiku
2016-06-02 16:41:48	Zachary_DuBois	Illya: uhhh, sheriffs dept.....
2016-06-02 16:41:50	Dhs92	Illya: Probably switching back to Dhs92
2016-06-02 16:41:53	nerdshark	personal interests are irrelevant
2016-06-02 16:41:56	nexia	nerdshark: if that's what the resume requires, rather than personal hobbies. sure :P
2016-06-02 16:41:58	nerdshark	unless they  make you a better candidate
2016-06-02 16:42:03	Zachary_DuBois	Illya: like actual deputy sheriff
2016-06-02 16:42:07	nerdshark	that's  what professionalism requires
2016-06-02 16:42:20	nerdshark	nobody gives a fuck about your personal interests unless they make you better  at your job
2016-06-02 16:42:38	nerdshark	*unless* that's the case, they don't belong
2016-06-02 16:42:46	Zachary_DuBois	Illya: Also, Day Automation (http://www.dayautomation.com) is corporate. They handle systems for 200+ schools, colleges, and companies in New York.
2016-06-02 16:42:46	@Suzuka	[title] Day Automation Systems
2016-06-02 16:42:49	nexia	dismissing someone solely on the fact that they listed those interests and automatically dismissing them as some sort of obsessed antisocial incompetent sounds dumb is all I was saying.
2016-06-02 16:42:57	Dhs92	*At interview for anime news network* So.. you like, watch anime and stuff? 
2016-06-02 16:42:58	Dhs92	Yes
2016-06-02 16:43:01	nerdshark	well, get some experience and then talk  to me
2016-06-02 16:43:03	Dhs92	Get out of here you fuckin' weeb
2016-06-02 16:43:10	Zachary_DuBois	^
2016-06-02 16:43:15	nerdshark	Dhs92: that's a case where an interest in anime is appropriate
2016-06-02 16:43:15	Sasazuka	nexia: actually chances are it's possible people will immediately drop resumes like that
2016-06-02 16:43:16	Illya	nerdshark: I think you gotta chill
2016-06-02 16:43:23	nerdshark	i'm chill
2016-06-02 16:43:31	Illya	ok
2016-06-02 16:43:31	Sasazuka	it can happen, but I wouldn't say it's 100%
2016-06-02 16:43:36	nexia	"oh dough i'm old and therefore what i say is more correct"
2016-06-02 16:43:41	nerdshark	it's a PRETTY good chance
2016-06-02 16:43:42	Sasazuka	I wouldn't even say it's a majority
2016-06-02 16:43:50	Illya	nerdshark: it's good to say that you do other things than program tho
2016-06-02 16:43:52	otakucheetah	you can always put on resume that you love reading technical manuals
2016-06-02 16:44:04	otakucheetah	someone actually put that on a resume...
2016-06-02 16:44:07	nexia	Sasazuka, clearly as shark pointed out it's professional not to list personal hobbies. I wouldn't list an interest in marvel comics either
2016-06-02 16:44:13	nerdshark	Illya: it's fine  to talk about it if it comes up in  the interview
2016-06-02 16:44:16	nexia	but like, based solely on it being japanese
2016-06-02 16:44:17	nexia	or anime
2016-06-02 16:44:20	nexia	no
2016-06-02 16:44:21	Sasazuka	nexia: if I saw that on a resume, I'd just skip over it
2016-06-02 16:44:38	Dhs92	nexia: discordia
2016-06-02 16:44:42	nexia	Sasazuka: Depending on what the hiring context was, sure.
2016-06-02 16:44:42	nerdshark	but when  i'm sorting through  resumes, i don't want to read a bunch of bullshit about how you like video games and anime or sports or whatever
2016-06-02 16:44:57	nexia	Dhs92, ok
2016-06-02 16:45:01	Sasazuka	nexia: I mean I'd skip the interest section, not the whole resume
2016-06-02 16:45:01	nerdshark	that's a  waste of my time
2016-06-02 16:45:20	nexia	Sasazuka, oh. well nerdshark would skip the whole resume it seems :P
2016-06-02 16:45:39	Sasazuka	nerdshark: to be honest, what teen would have a resume like that? has work experience, resume looks clean, etc
2016-06-02 16:45:44	nerdshark	it's possible, unless they were a must-hire
2016-06-02 16:45:55	nerdshark	Sasazuka: no  teen would have  a good resume
2016-06-02 16:46:00	nexia	 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-06-02 16:46:06	Sasazuka	well isn't he a teen?
2016-06-02 16:46:11	nerdshark	who
2016-06-02 16:46:15	Sasazuka	Zachary_DuBois
2016-06-02 16:46:18	nexia	that depends on the person lol
2016-06-02 16:46:20	colel	It all depends on what you accomplished as a teenager
2016-06-02 16:46:21	nerdshark	yes
2016-06-02 16:46:25	nerdshark	apparently
2016-06-02 16:46:33	nexia	i know lots of teenagers who are very good, efficent mature individuals
2016-06-02 16:46:33	Zachary_DuBois	Huh
2016-06-02 16:46:33	nerdshark	Zachary_DuBois is probably an exception
2016-06-02 16:46:35	Sasazuka	so I'd say the header is whatever
2016-06-02 16:46:36	Zachary_DuBois	I'm 17
2016-06-02 16:46:38	nerdshark	i didn't look at his site or resume
2016-06-02 16:46:51	nexia	"probably an exception" ok i'm done

2016-06-02 16:47:30	nexia	my friend who just turned 17 got out of school straight away, is an expert in IT server management etc and is apparently "learning" at his workplace

2016-06-02 16:47:45	nerdshark	no 17 year old is  an expert at anything
2016-06-02 16:47:47	Illya	and I'd like to learn TeX

2016-06-02 16:48:06	nerdshark	nexia: how much work experience did he have?
2016-06-02 16:48:06	Illya	nerdshark: the lead dev of x264 was 17
2016-06-02 16:48:23	nerdshark	okay i'll  grant you exceptions
2016-06-02 16:48:31	nerdshark	nearly no 17 year old is an expert at anything
2016-06-02 16:48:35	nexia	if you're experienced in it, programming since a young age, you can be a fucking expert
2016-06-02 16:48:40	Illya	please refrain from making sweeping statements
2016-06-02 16:48:43	nexia	you put such a huge emphasis on age
2016-06-02 16:48:43	nerdshark	also,  how  good was x264 when it was released
2016-06-02 16:48:45	nexia	it's disgusting
2016-06-02 16:48:53	nerdshark	nexia: experience makes an expert
2016-06-02 16:48:53	Illya	nerdshark: was alright
2016-06-02 16:48:56	nerdshark	experience comes with age
2016-06-02 16:49:02	nerdshark	there is a heavy correlation
2016-06-02 16:49:02	Zachary_DuBois	I started coding when I was 8 dude
2016-06-02 16:49:05	nexia	nerdshark: yes, and people can start from a young age

2016-06-02 16:51:37	Zachary_DuBois	Dude, I am building a weather buoy and the permit for flotation devices requires you to be 18. New York actually exempt me from that requirement.
2016-06-02 16:51:40	nexia	Dhs92, did you see my 110 BPM stream video

2016-06-02 16:51:52	nexia	Zachary_DuBois, when do you turn 18?

2016-06-02 16:52:04	nexia	Dhs92, aw alright, i get you..
2016-06-02 16:52:08	nerdshark	experience is king, and it heavily correlates with age, but there are exceptions for those who start young
2016-06-02 16:52:10	Fenderbassist	I'm very disappointed in the lack of DOS and CP/M skills being discussed, but otherwise I'd say that's a pretty good resume for 17 :)
2016-06-02 16:52:12	Zachary_DuBois	nexia: September
2016-06-02 16:52:12	nexia	Dhs92: when does summer vacation start there?

2016-06-02 16:57:52	Nanobot	The design spec for the buttons calls for a gradient transition on hover. CSS doesn't support gradient transitions, since they're technically background images. So, I simulated the same look using a fixed gradient over a transitioning background color and inset box shadow, and I fine-tuned it until the difference isn't noticeable.

2016-06-02 23:43:24	pyon	geela: Also, you're telling me Firefox is *only* using 2GB RAM?
2016-06-02 23:43:29	Zachary_DuBois	Also, it is probably because one of the server providers I use is having some issues.
2016-06-02 23:43:48	kosan	Zachary_DuBois: Well, if I hosted my own bouncer, my bouncer would be disconnecting periodically, defeating the purpose of using it to *avoid* my interment net drops.

2016-06-02 23:44:18	Zachary_DuBois	Bouncers are hosted on servers, not home machines 
2016-06-02 23:44:26	geela	I'm trying to keep it under 30 windows
2016-06-02 23:44:30	Jupely	PaleMoon is the best one I tried.
2016-06-02 23:44:41	geela	is there an add-on to manage your windows?
2016-06-02 23:44:43	pyon	geela: I have more than 30 tabs... per window.
2016-06-02 23:44:44	kosan	So *you* don't host it, you rent a VPS and host it there. That's still relying on a provider...
2016-06-02 23:45:16	Zachary_DuBois	kosan: .... Providers have literally 99.99% uptime
2016-06-02 23:45:23	pyon	Oh, and I'm also running Chromium separately for those things where speed matters.
2016-06-02 23:45:27	Zachary_DuBois	The only time mine disconnects is when I do system maintenance
2016-06-02 23:45:27	geela	what is compressed memory and why does it have 700mb ram?
2016-06-02 23:45:40	geela	I use chrome, is chromium better?
2016-06-02 23:45:46	kosan	Zachary_DuBois: And this service usually has a fairly decent uptime as well, considering it's a free service they provide.
2016-06-02 23:46:04	kosan	They just recently switched domains, so I was expecting some hiccups along the way.

2016-06-02 23:47:27	Zachary_DuBois	So the the fact it is having issues is unrelated
2016-06-02 23:47:47	geela	forget what I said about w10 fixing ram leaks...

2016-06-03 19:17:26	thunderface	I did that for 2 years
2016-06-03 19:17:51	thunderface	Then I asked myself why I was learning to fight from a guy who couldn't lift his foot above his knee

2016-06-03 19:19:34	Fenderbassist	thunderface: prior to that was aikido and isshinryu karates, as far as wushu I can't say cause I did it very briefly, I think the tai chi practicioners with years of experience might do better
2016-06-03 19:20:03	Fenderbassist	thunderface: ah I watched vids on european sword fighting, it was awesome
2016-06-03 19:20:07	zoys	like... fencing?

2016-06-03 19:21:22	thunderface	Directly from the original manuscript
2016-06-03 19:21:40	thunderface	So it's not for defence, you're supposed to attack and kill people

2016-06-03 19:26:11	Illya	it looks like they're literally trying to kill each other
2016-06-03 19:26:12	zoys	they have heavy mail competitions?

2016-06-03 19:29:12	Urchin	full plate rocks!
2016-06-03 19:29:17	thunderface	Maybe in a period restrictive competition, like just 1300s
2016-06-03 19:29:24	zoys	i'm a big roman history fan, it'd be fun to do a roman style even

2016-06-03 19:29:52	zoys	helmets
2016-06-03 19:30:04	thunderface	Lots of small plates instead of one big one. Easier to repair
2016-06-03 19:30:24	Urchin	full plate distributes the shock across a large surface, there really isn't anything better than that

2016-06-03 19:31:49	hassoon	thunderface: what ?
2016-06-03 19:31:52	Urchin	Rome abandoned the phalanx as soon as it acquired some more territory in hilly terrain
2016-06-03 19:31:57	hassoon	what steam and what wall
2016-06-03 19:32:06	thunderface	Adapted. Not abandoned

2016-06-03 19:34:18	thunderface	Nah. For the first decade or two it was just another tool.
2016-06-03 19:34:19	Fenderbassist	yeah the classical Greek phalanx of standing aside of each other, overlapping your shield was dropped in favor of more maneuverable legionary formations

I'm reading through all the existing migrate code, trying to get familiar with how it all works. I got to the part where it figures out which migrates are ready to run and haven't been run yet. The code does a bunch of work to initialize this array structure prior to populating it with data, and after
2016-06-03 20:47:13	Nanobot	 all of that, it then populates the array via $array = someFunc($some, $other, $parameters);

2016-06-03 21:21:00	zoys	just not much selective pressure
2016-06-03 21:21:38	zoys	but i think it's largely due to how our brains work, physiologically
2016-06-03 21:22:06	zoys	we have some switch that can be flipped and suddenly a group of people become "others" to us, and non-human

2016-06-03 21:26:09	zoys	another example is police, same thing is the reason for police brutality, a switch just gets flipped and they're a "perp" or "criminal" and treated as sub-human

2016-06-04 16:53:10	Fenderbassist	Yuken: though seeing Vegeta with a "Freddie Mercury" moustache was priceless
2016-06-04 16:53:18	Yuken	What it is is basically a comedic Dragon Ball series, dubbing over the original footage with... voice acting good enough to be on prime-time Adult Swim (no 10-cent mouse or whatever)
2016-06-04 16:53:23	Yuken	That was in GT, wasn't it?
2016-06-04 16:53:29	Fenderbassist	Yuken: and seeing him get bent out of shape at the girls laughing at him was even more so

2016-06-04 20:12:33	GGLucas	Don't vote for candidates you agree with. Vote for candidates who you think will do a good job spending their time informing themselves and are honest and intelligent people. Then don't throw a hissy fit when they decide something you disagree with, it's their job to know better.

2016-06-04 20:14:35	Illya	so, I dont know what that is
2016-06-04 20:14:50	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: I'll have to think about that, an uninformed public trusting an auto pilot government...
2016-06-04 20:15:23	Yuken	Illya, two high-ranking teams, one of the first matches ever streamed on national television, TBS.
2016-06-04 20:15:33	Yuken	G2 choked hard and lost the match, even though they are the better of the two teams.
2016-06-04 20:15:48	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: I was raised under the impression that the public here was to try to be informed, and hold politicians accountable...though that doesn't seem to be the case nearly enough....
2016-06-04 20:15:50	GGLucas	Fenderbassist: Doesn't have to be auto-pilot, but important decisions deserve to have someone reading, thinking and discussing about it for weeks or even months. I have a job so I don't have time for that, and like anything else in this world I don't have time to do, I pay someone else to do it.
2016-06-04 20:16:16	Illya	Yuken: I know of "GS9"
2016-06-04 20:17:40	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: sure, and I only meant "auto pilot" from the view of the citizenry....I find it so hard to trust politicians given the historical record....and I am no expert on this....and now with corporations having more rights than they should, with their money influencing everything...
2016-06-04 20:18:38	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: it's just my personal opinion, but I'd love to see more citizens become as informed as they can, participate even in local-level government (town meetings, holding the council to account, etc)
2016-06-04 20:19:20	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: so that people elected to positions at any level don't think they can do as they wish with little attention being paid them
2016-06-04 20:19:48	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: lots of money, political power, the public not really watching = makes me nervous
2016-06-04 20:20:28	GGLucas	Fenderbassist: They *should* think they can do as they wish. Almost all of the bad decisions are taken because of pressure from loud voters.
2016-06-04 20:20:48	Fenderbassist	GGLucas: the political moves to remove, for example, collective bargaining rights....that was an indicator for me
2016-06-04 20:20:51	GGLucas	The only problem you need to take care of then is indeed corporation kickbacks, but somehow I doubt that could get any worse than it is.
2016-06-04 20:21:18	Illya	what's the point of giving people life sentences?
2016-06-04 20:21:34	Illya	You might as well give them a death sentence
2016-06-04 20:21:53	GGLucas	If the politicians were just allowed to do their fucking jobs without having to pander and grandstand so their voters think they're bad-ass and anti-establishment a lot more would get done.
2016-06-04 20:22:36	Fenderbassist	Illya: there's a good argument for both sides of that issue....it really comes down to money vs humanitarianism I suppose
2016-06-04 20:22:44	Illya	Sure, they "suffer" for longer, but seriously? why are we making people suffer when we can do the right thing? Retribution is hardly ever as good as it seems

2016-06-04 20:25:09	GGLucas	Death sentences are also more expensive than life sentences to carry out.

2016-06-04 21:13:27	crutchy	stallman didn't invent the concept of volunteering
2016-06-04 21:13:46	crutchy	or public domain copyright
2016-06-04 21:13:55	Fenderbassist	crutchy: nope, and he didn't invent books or sewing or discussions or meatloaf...
2016-06-04 21:14:10	crutchy	the only reason why he's anybody was that torvalds happen to choose a license that he wrote
2016-06-04 21:14:33	Fenderbassist	well I respect your opinion but I certainly don't agree with it, and that's ok
2016-06-04 21:14:47	crutchy	without torvalds, stallman would be a footnote in the pages of software history
2016-06-04 21:14:58	luke-jr	crutchy: uh, no.
2016-06-04 21:15:07	Myrl-saki	oh boy
2016-06-04 21:15:10	Fenderbassist	I think not, but I'm not threatened by that viewpoint
2016-06-04 21:15:12	luke-jr	Linux is just a kernel. 99% of GNU/Linux systems is GNU software.
2016-06-04 21:15:21	crutchy	no its not
2016-06-04 21:15:23	Myrl-saki	I was watching Plastic Memories and UBW on my WIndows box. I didn't know at all.
2016-06-04 21:15:26	luke-jr	well, 99% of the common software anyway
2016-06-04 21:15:36	crutchy	99% of linux has nothing to do with gnu
2016-06-04 21:15:39	luke-jr	obviously when you add on distro-specific stuff like DEs, GNU becomes less relevant
2016-06-04 21:15:52	luke-jr	in any case, GNU software is always more relevant than Linux

2016-06-04 22:44:13	beaky	why is buddha fat
2016-06-04 22:44:22	beaky	isnt he supposed to be skinny and ascetic
2016-06-04 22:44:26	Fenderbassist	zoys: same, I used to work out 5 days a week, even did split routines
2016-06-04 22:44:28	beaky	since he gives up worldly desires of food

2016-06-04 22:44:46	shad0wshayd3	ironically to do that he had to put on a few pounds
2016-06-04 22:44:48	beaky	is being fat enlightening

2016-06-04 22:49:41	zoys	but gautama took the middle path, he started as royalty and found it offered no satisfaction, saw death, old age, sickness, decided to leave and become an ascetic, give up worldly desires for food as beaky said lol

At our movie nights Izzy will try and "psycho-analyse" the characters in all the films, even one's she's picked, and complains about the character tropes and forced romances throughout them. It's completely ruined movie nights, so 
2016-06-06 12:35:30	CosmicWitch_	last week I didn't even schedule one so I didn't have to deal with it. I know Sam is upset by all of this because she's cried to me a few times, but each time I bring it up to Izzy she says she doesn't care and we should "check our privilege"?

2016-06-06 23:08:08	Duns_Scrotus	 According to the judges: Reiser's complaint was too long (more than 300 pages in its original form). He had too many defendants, and they included judges, who are immune to lawsuits regarding their official conduct. Finally, the judges couldn't decide whether there was a cause of action (any illegal deed or event, which could be prosecuted) to accept the plea. Reiser argued that he had not had access to the
2016-06-06 23:08:10	Duns_Scrotus	prison law library and that he had been denied the appointment of an attorney to help him formulate his complaint.

2016-06-06 23:30:11	Fenderbassist	hassoon: I don't think they get them for free, especially given that police and agency models come with lots of upgrades, but they get fleet prices based on contracts
2016-06-06 23:30:37	Fenderbassist	hassoon: and per regulations, after a certain age they are auctioned off to the public

2016-06-07 00:31:31	BillyZane	^ this is important ya'll
2016-06-07 00:31:46	Fenderbassist	stallmen: reading the description of it, it sounds very interesting
2016-06-07 00:31:48	BillyZane	every time I ever had success attracting a girl, it's cause I followed this
2016-06-07 00:32:14	BillyZane	1 is super important
2016-06-07 00:32:48	BillyZane	do not be a fucking push over around other guys. Be bossy to other males. Let a girl follow you like those runners followed forest gump
2016-06-07 00:33:44	BillyZane	does anyone here know about audio equipment
2016-06-07 00:33:46	BillyZane	or is an audiophile
2016-06-07 00:33:51	Fenderbassist	BillyZane: good info
2016-06-07 00:33:57	BillyZane	Fenderbassist, yup
2016-06-07 00:34:04	Fenderbassist	BillyZane: I'm out of the market but you younger ones should read that :)
2016-06-07 00:34:43	BillyZane	and i think that list is pretty much good in order of appearance
2016-06-07 00:34:47	BillyZane	like 1 is by far the most important thing
2016-06-07 00:35:09	BillyZane	because women are attracted to dominant men the way men are attracted to an hour glass figure
2016-06-07 00:35:14	unicornjedi	BillyZane: I cant help you with audio equipment
2016-06-07 00:35:18	BillyZane	and you don't have to be big or strong to be dominant
2016-06-07 00:35:22	BillyZane	unicornjedi, oh, :\ oh well
2016-06-07 00:35:28	BillyZane	I was thinking of getting something
2016-06-07 00:35:31	unicornjedi	BillyZane: I mean I can
2016-06-07 00:35:43	BillyZane	I want to get something good for a good price. not sure where to go 
2016-06-07 00:35:50	BillyZane	best buy didn't really have a great selection
2016-06-07 00:35:55	BillyZane	and amazon marks everything up 50%
2016-06-07 00:36:06	beaky	BillyZane: how do i be bossy over other males
2016-06-07 00:36:10	unicornjedi	BillyZane: have you tried guitar center? or goodwill?
2016-06-07 00:36:11	beaky	so that i can attract a mate
2016-06-07 00:36:26	unicornjedi	BillyZane: what are you looking for? or do you know what you are looking for?
2016-06-07 00:36:29	BillyZane	unicornjedi, i want something akin to a studio monitor
2016-06-07 00:36:34	BillyZane	and a subwoofer, preferably powered
2016-06-07 00:36:50	Fenderbassist	BillyZane: I have better luck on eBay for that stuff
2016-06-07 00:37:19	unicornjedi	BillyZane: M-audio have some monitors that are cheap and entry level I believe
2016-06-07 00:38:04	unicornjedi	BillyZane: how big do you want the diaphram of the speakers to be?
2016-06-07 00:38:27	CosmicWitch	you need some 12s mang
2016-06-07 00:39:09	BillyZane	beaky, that is a good question. the way you do it is by being confident when you speak. don't put your eyes down, don't speak meekly. also, amass more allies than anyone else. sometimes being physical dominant goes hand-in-hand with that, but you can be small and still have dominance over bigger guys
2016-06-07 00:39:15	unicornjedi	CosmicWitch: : im using 12s right now they are boss
2016-06-07 00:39:36	beaky	but im meek and weak
2016-06-07 00:39:42	stallmen	i didn't get nhk ni youkoso
2016-06-07 00:39:51	beaky	its about the neet hikikomori life
2016-06-07 00:40:07	BillyZane	unicornjedi, yeah, M-audio has some $400 monitors and a subwoofer. there are several other brands that provide a similar setup at a similar price. however, i don't want to spend $750 on a powered sub/monitors
2016-06-07 00:40:46	BillyZane	i'll give you an example of when I was dominant
2016-06-07 00:42:01	CosmicWitch	did you do helicopter penis
2016-06-07 00:42:07	BillyZane	I was at a math study group.  there was about 10 people there, a few hot girls as well. I was asked to present my proof for a homework assignment that took me 4 hours to prove. I said, "No. we can't all just submit the exact same proof. Also, if I gave the proof, it would take away from my originality." it was dead silence. every guy there looked down, and not at my eye. the one hot chick stood up and said, "i'm going to sit next to him."
2016-06-07 00:42:09	CosmicWitch	you just pull your pants down and flop that bad boy around
2016-06-07 00:42:14	CosmicWitch	while not breaking eye contact
2016-06-07 00:42:41	unicornjedi	BillyZane: if you really want some cheap monitors... find cabinets that use car speakers
2016-06-07 00:43:00	BillyZane	and ever since then, that girl found me very attractive
2016-06-07 00:43:01	unicornjedi	BillyZane: i believe car speakers have a flat frequency response
2016-06-07 00:43:06	CosmicWitch	he obviously wants some neutral voicing on his monitors
2016-06-07 00:43:11	CosmicWitch	unicornjedi, not really
2016-06-07 00:43:22	BillyZane	because i did rule #1. i stood up for my self, and i never bossed her around
2016-06-07 00:43:34	CosmicWitch	if a speaker has a flat frequency response, that is usually a selling point
2016-06-07 00:44:00	BillyZane	CosmicWitch, i just want to hear all the music. lows, mid and highs
2016-06-07 00:44:06	BillyZane	^
2016-06-07 00:44:12	unicornjedi	CosmicWitch: well if it has an almost flat response rate, then you can easily EQ it
2016-06-07 00:44:17	CosmicWitch	then you need a good quality subwoofer
2016-06-07 00:44:19	BillyZane	i didn't want to use the word frequency response, but that is what it is, lol
2016-06-07 00:44:23	CosmicWitch	and a proper loudspeaker
2016-06-07 00:44:34	CosmicWitch	you dont need a studio monitor for that specifically
2016-06-07 00:44:40	BillyZane	CosmicWitch, that's what i'm in the market for at a good price. lookin to spend $400 at the most if possible
2016-06-07 00:45:08	CosmicWitch	subs are good for between 20-100 hz and the rest comes from a loudspeaker, a monitor is an option for that
2016-06-07 00:45:16	CosmicWitch	hmmmmm
2016-06-07 00:45:38	CosmicWitch	I have loudspeakers that respond okay until about 25hz
2016-06-07 00:45:44	CosmicWitch	but below that they just waste power
2016-06-07 00:45:51	BillyZane	yeah, i've seen some that go down to 28 and 27, i haven't seen a 20hz sub yet
2016-06-07 00:46:02	BillyZane	yeah i want to get something that's low
2016-06-07 00:46:02	CosmicWitch	thats probably fine
2016-06-07 00:46:04	unicornjedi	BillyZane: do you want a passive subwoofer hooked up to a sound receiver? that might be cheap
2016-06-07 00:46:21	BillyZane	if it's cheaper, yes
2016-06-07 00:46:32	luke-jr	anyone here use irssi?

2016-06-07 00:47:30	stallmen	I think nhk ni youkoso is my favorite anime I've completed so far. I've only completed about 3 series though
2016-06-07 00:47:31	BillyZane	but dude, $100 ?
2016-06-07 00:47:47	unicornjedi	BillyZane: do you want one thats 50 bucks?
2016-06-07 00:48:11	BillyZane	ummm... but this isn't powered

2016-06-07 00:48:14	Fenderbassist	stallmen: keep going !!
2016-06-07 00:48:29	BillyZane	but that isn't a problem. can i get a reciever that can power that and 2 monitors for $300 ?
2016-06-07 00:48:29	+Moyst	It's 'receiver'.
2016-06-07 00:48:31	unicornjedi	BillyZane: you said you wouldn't mind hooking it up to a sound reciever
2016-06-07 00:48:37	BillyZane	receiver*

2016-06-07 00:49:21	BillyZane	i don't mind having that, i could probably get 2
2016-06-07 00:49:27	BillyZane	get one for my car
2016-06-07 00:49:36	BillyZane	but this is for my friend's house. i plan on keeping a stereo at his pad
2016-06-07 00:50:08	unicornjedi	BillyZane: :(
2016-06-07 00:50:14	BillyZane	it's all good
2016-06-07 00:50:23	BillyZane	i just don't want to spend more than $400
2016-06-07 00:50:50	BillyZane	but given the diameter and wattage, i guess that would be able to go very low

2016-06-07 01:03:22	otakucheetah	exactally.. coolness is a matter of perspective
2016-06-07 01:03:57	unicornjedi	BillyZane: you can easily get rid of rattling by putting sound dampening materials under the subwoofer

2016-06-07 01:04:32	CosmicWitch	BillyZane, low hz response eats up Watts like nothing

2016-06-07 01:07:14	BillyZane	hmmm
2016-06-07 01:07:19	CosmicWitch	regular loudspeakers should be cheaper than monitors

2016-06-22 09:12:32	akaseki	mathu, I'm more worried about C#, where I'm still in infancy stage (far from the requirements)... Still, it's just a junior dev job..
2016-06-22 09:12:44	davic	akaseki: I want to learn C#
2016-06-22 09:12:55	davic	but it just looks so fucking complex

2016-06-22 09:13:15	akaseki	mathu, in your case.. idk.. it depends on how much you want a job for the "future" or that allows you to live out your life
2016-06-22 09:13:30	davic	amigojapan: it isn't similar to other coding languages I know
2016-06-22 09:13:47	pyon	davic: What do you already know? Besides Ruby.
2016-06-22 09:13:53	amigojapan	davic: it is in lne of C++ likish language
2016-06-22 09:13:57	akaseki	mathu, i.e a demanding job now will take a big toll on your social and family life but will allow you for better jobs later... The other option still has a chance of a good job, but not that much.. and family and friends aren't a guarantee either way
2016-06-22 09:13:59	davic	some minimal python
2016-06-22 09:14:06	akaseki	davic, not that complex. Do you know C++ ?
2016-06-22 09:14:10	davic	php, perl, tcl, coffeescript
2016-06-22 09:14:13	davic	akaseki: I Dont

2016-06-22 09:15:37	davic	pyon: most of them is built in C? though
2016-06-22 09:15:39	akaseki	pyon, php does enough
2016-06-22 09:15:40	pyon	amigojapan: Also, C++ and C# are pretty different. C++ emphasizes value semantics, stack allocation, knowing who owns what resource, etc.
2016-06-22 09:16:11	amigojapan	agreed pyon , but he should eventually learn a language like C++ Javascript , or say python
2016-06-22 09:16:19	amigojapan	pyon: or java

2016-06-22 09:17:17	akaseki	davic, it's like C++ only both better and gayer 
2016-06-22 09:17:41	akaseki	davic, everything is a class (even you Main() *which runs the program)
2016-06-22 09:17:41	davic	akaseki: I have it on my list to lrn though
2016-06-22 09:17:42	pyon	akaseki: Where's muh template metaprogramming? :-p
2016-06-22 09:17:51	pyon	akaseki: If Boost is inexpressible in it, it's different enough from C++.
2016-06-22 09:18:06	akaseki	pyon, in C++, along with ulcers, male pattern baldness and insanity 
2016-06-22 09:18:11	pyon	haha

2016-06-22 09:18:37	pyon	Dunno, I actually kinda enjoy using C++, relative to C# or Java. It only makes me swear every two days, as opposed to every day.
2016-06-22 09:18:38	akaseki	I didn't have an interest in C# because meh
2016-06-22 09:18:41	akaseki	but now joooob
2016-06-22 09:18:42	akaseki	:(
2016-06-22 09:19:01	davic	akaseki: C# is alright though
2016-06-22 09:19:03	akaseki	it is
2016-06-22 09:19:04	davic	Java though
2016-06-22 09:19:10	davic	I would quit a job for skipping that

2016-06-22 09:19:27	akaseki	that are in opposition with what i've learned in C++
2016-06-22 09:19:35	pyon	davic: You can think C# as Java with lots of lipstick on top of the pig.
2016-06-22 09:19:44	amigojapan	C# is like Java withought bullshit
2016-06-22 09:19:53	davic	pyon: atleast it isnt java

2016-06-22 09:19:54	akaseki	yeah davic, C# and Java bear some resemblance

2016-06-22 09:20:51	davic	Illya: there is a reason why my elasticsearch VM have 20 GB of RAM provided for it
2016-06-22 09:20:58	davic	and 6 CPUs
2016-06-22 09:21:04	davic	akaseki: sure
2016-06-22 09:21:10	pyon	davic: In all fairness, you couldn't do ElasticSearch at all in Ruby or Python.

2016-06-22 09:44:38	bagelsan	im awake and i didnt hallucinate
2016-06-22 09:44:41	bagelsan	lol
2016-06-22 09:44:53	akaseki	davic, what us a PR?
2016-06-22 09:45:37	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: I understand, and just to be clear...I wasn't implying you'd be deceitful.  They look for consistency
2016-06-22 09:45:53	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, the only thing interesting about it is for about 15 minutes you get that feeling before a psychedelic drug trip starts
2016-06-22 09:46:09	bagelsan	but nothing happens
2016-06-22 09:46:45	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: I find that listening to relaxation/meditation/dream music and nature sounds put me into a slightly altered state of consciousness
2016-06-22 09:46:49	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, but he does ask a few questions. its kinda funny he said : you may get a feeling that you dont want to return, thats normal. that is just your mind pushing back.
2016-06-22 09:47:02	bagelsan	i think i dont want to go because its kinda dumb but why not?
2016-06-22 09:47:06	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: I have never been hypnotised so that must be a whole other experience
2016-06-22 09:47:28	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: it's better if you go, consistency could yield you better support programs
2016-06-22 09:47:35	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, neither have i. ive yet to ¨go under¨ just had sessions
2016-06-22 09:47:55	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: of course, like Office Space (which I just got), I could have been and don't realize it :)
2016-06-22 09:48:12	davic	akaseki: pull request
2016-06-22 09:49:01	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, honestly its just focusing way too hard on whats going on with your mind and body.
2016-06-22 09:49:29	bagelsan	but hes not doing the stupid finger snapping shit so i can assume hes not a total quack
2016-06-22 09:49:42	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, but he uses A LOT of ¨key words¨
2016-06-22 09:50:41	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: interesting, my various therapy sessions with psychiatrists and psychologists never had that, I only got to experience the questioning where I had to keep coming up with answers to lead to realizations
2016-06-22 09:50:53	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: I never had what you're having now, to be honest
2016-06-22 09:51:16	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: do you feel hypnotism is effective at all?
2016-06-22 09:51:19	hassoon	hid|ninja: je réside ici, u mad nab ?
2016-06-22 09:51:27	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, i have never had one like this. but i had a lot of shit therapists that talk to me about the most mundane shit like gardening and cooking
2016-06-22 09:51:42	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, i feel that it accomplishes ´something´ but what that something is. i dont know.
2016-06-22 09:51:53	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: ah trying to find a positive activity to build up from, I suppose

2016-06-22 09:52:37	beaky	ah
2016-06-22 09:52:42	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, its theraputic
2016-06-22 09:52:45	Fenderbassist	beaky: in some cases, getting people to face up to issues by talking about them to find better ways to deal with them
2016-06-22 09:52:45	bagelsan	er

2016-06-22 09:53:22	beaky	>.< neethood
2016-06-22 09:53:23	Fenderbassist	beaky: running away from problems often causes many troubles, so...
2016-06-22 09:53:32	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, im sorry but every time he tries to hypnotize me all i can do is think this fucker is going to rape my ass if he can actually put me under
2016-06-22 09:53:46	Fenderbassist	beaky: you make an appointment or join a group therapy session or support group
2016-06-22 09:54:03	bagelsan	i mean hes a really nice guy. but i guess its just weird.
2016-06-22 09:54:11	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: I totally understand you there, I'm very into self protection
2016-06-22 09:54:26	beaky	can i get therapy
2016-06-22 09:54:28	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: losing control is a huge thing for some of us
2016-06-22 09:54:29	beaky	to not be a neet
2016-06-22 09:54:30	beaky	and face life
2016-06-22 09:54:43	beaky	and finally get a job and gain actual competency in life
2016-06-22 09:54:45	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, he talks about ´letting go´
2016-06-22 09:54:49	Fenderbassist	beaky: of course, that is a classic condition for treatment
2016-06-22 09:54:54	bagelsan	he doesnt use the term control though
2016-06-22 09:55:06	beaky	am i classic
2016-06-22 09:55:10	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: yeah, a lot of stress/hangups/avoidance issues stem from people hanging onto problems or the past with a vice grip
2016-06-22 09:55:22	Fenderbassist	beaky: you are classic in several ways, especially in your coolness

2016-06-22 09:55:44	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, i honestly wont talk about it but i think some of my issues stem from situations with a particular ex gf.
2016-06-22 09:55:51	Fenderbassist	beaky: you're very "hippy cool" in that you don't try to use IRC to injure others
2016-06-22 09:56:11	Fenderbassist	beaky: you only criticize yourself, which tells me you're "good people"
2016-06-22 09:56:39	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: could be, many of mine did...I spent a long long long time working on those
2016-06-22 09:56:54	beaky	does self-criticism make one good
2016-06-22 09:56:59	Fenderbassist	beaky: and you have cool interests
2016-06-22 09:57:10	beaky	is anime a cool interest
2016-06-22 09:57:12	Fenderbassist	beaky: when it's the only negative form of expression, it means you value and respect others
2016-06-22 09:57:17	Fenderbassist	beaky: yes it is, very creative
2016-06-22 09:57:38	Fenderbassist	beaky: I'm watching Mushishi now
2016-06-22 09:57:45	Fenderbassist	beaky: saw the first one, awesome

2016-06-22 09:58:05	Fenderbassist	about it*

2016-06-22 09:59:06	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: it's a great lesson to put aside our intense views and realize that the planet just rotates

2016-06-22 10:02:09	Fenderbassist	therue: no, I just run it after doing all the account and security recommended settings
2016-06-22 10:02:25	Fenderbassist	therue: there is a huge user's guide online though
2016-06-22 10:02:30	Fenderbassist	therue: did you look there?
2016-06-22 10:02:40	therue	ya
2016-06-22 10:02:43	Fenderbassist	ok
2016-06-22 10:02:54	Fenderbassist	what about the IRC channel, I think there's one?
2016-06-22 10:03:11	beaky	Fenderbassist do you think human grandma and mushi grandma are the same person
2016-06-22 10:03:27	beaky	or are they completely different beings
2016-06-22 10:03:28	therue	i asked once, but wasn't exactly sure how to go about it. i dind't want to keep nagging them hehe :>
2016-06-22 10:03:33	Fenderbassist	beaky: I did, based on the subs....and the fact that they both cared about the boy
2016-06-22 10:04:29	mathu	akaseki: yeah idk what kind of work-life balance to aim for if i don't know whether or not i'll even have a life outside work haha
2016-06-22 10:04:50	beaky	my life is no work and all life
2016-06-22 10:04:56	Fenderbassist	therue: I understand, perhaps one of the user forums can help you, let me see if I can find one
2016-06-22 10:05:00	beaky	yet in many ways, i have no life
2016-06-22 10:05:23	therue	thanks
2016-06-22 10:05:43	mathu	akaseki: the thing about c# that makes me sad is that documentation isn't that great. i'm fine w the language but all the .NET stuff i've done has been, like, impenetrable apart from out-of-the-box kinda stuff

2016-06-22 10:08:01	therue	i'll check it out :> thanks man
2016-06-22 10:08:17	akaseki	mathu, yeah, honestly it does. whenever you search for something, if it's MSDN, click on stackexchange (although it has limited value as well because of either the usual arrogant dicks or ppl who can't express themselves to save their dick from a bush-fire)
2016-06-22 10:08:47	beaky	donuts. not even once
2016-06-22 10:08:56	Fenderbassist	therue: I looked around, the rest are GNU/Linux distro specific forums but you could probably ask there too, to see if an experienced user can help
2016-06-22 10:08:58	beaky	how do american police people binge on donuts yet remain fit
2016-06-22 10:09:30	therue	ya, i'll try asking on some linux sub-reddit pages :>
2016-06-22 10:09:41	Fenderbassist	beaky: because they workout a lot to remain in top shape to deal with the public
2016-06-22 10:10:04	Fenderbassist	beaky: 3 police officers (one retired) in my family, the stories I hear would make me want to be totally ready for anything myself
2016-06-22 10:10:17	beaky	what is the best story
2016-06-22 10:11:21	Fenderbassist	beaky: the funniest one I heard was a young person on some kind of drugs carrying drugs (to deal maybe) in their jeans and prior to arrest, claiming that they borrowed the pants from a friend so the drugs weren't theirs
2016-06-22 10:11:59	Fenderbassist	beaky: the dangerous ones are usually domestic violence cases where one angry person pulled a gun on my brother-in-law cop, who had to then shoot him in defense
2016-06-22 10:12:01	akaseki	mathu, oh no pls not the stack
2016-06-22 10:12:06	akaseki	i suffer from it almost daily at work
2016-06-22 10:12:56	beaky	damn Fenderbassist 
2016-06-22 10:12:59	beaky	domestic violence is scary
2016-06-22 10:13:08	davic	beaky: it is
2016-06-22 10:13:20	davic	beaky: I know people that got ribs broken
2016-06-22 10:13:25	Fenderbassist	beaky: yep, some people aren't prepared for the stress of dealing with a spouse and work and bills and such
2016-06-22 10:13:25	davic	back fucked up
2016-06-22 10:13:26	davic	etc
2016-06-22 10:13:35	Fenderbassist	davic: wow
2016-06-22 10:13:38	beaky	im not prepared for the stress of life
2016-06-22 10:13:50	beaky	or domestic violnece
2016-06-22 10:14:02	davic	Fenderbassist: the person is still living with issues due to that
2016-06-22 10:14:03	Fenderbassist	beaky: but you can be, as a single guy...find your balance and THEN take on more
2016-06-22 10:14:08	akaseki	therue, you know what's funny?
2016-06-22 10:14:11	Fenderbassist	davic: must be brutal
2016-06-22 10:14:15	akaseki	therue, scrot means ballbag in romanian 
2016-06-22 10:14:35	akaseki	therue, also there's #weechat on here
2016-06-22 10:14:35	davic	Fenderbassist: the person cant pick anything up, bend down, work etc
2016-06-22 10:14:39	therue	a ballbag eh
2016-06-22 10:14:48	davic	went from 2 jobs per day to 0
2016-06-22 10:14:54	Fenderbassist	beaky: some Americans tend to rush into everything without really being ready for it, and eventually lose control from stress
2016-06-22 10:15:25	Fenderbassist	davic: I am truly sorry to hear that, I'm going in that direction myself
2016-06-22 10:15:35	akaseki	therue, also, may i recommend reading the manual?
2016-06-22 10:15:54	davic	Fenderbassist: if you are in a relationship like that
2016-06-22 10:15:57	mathu	beaky: ASP.NET MVC with C# deployed to IIS on Windows Server
2016-06-22 10:15:58	davic	run. Fucking run.
2016-06-22 10:15:58	Fenderbassist	beaky: there is something to be said for "sticking to the basics"
2016-06-22 10:16:08	mathu	beaky: like, the things you do are all MS technologies integrated w each other
2016-06-22 10:16:49	mathu	akaseki: with stackexchange though a lot of the results are equally unable to help
2016-06-22 10:16:59	Fenderbassist	davic: oh I totally agree, my relationship days are over but I do recall some gfs showing signs of abusive tendencies and so it didn't last long
2016-06-22 10:17:00	mathu	akaseki: like, a lot of things i try to do simply never show up in search results
2016-06-22 10:17:13	akaseki	mathu, but at least the language used doesn't make your brain hurt and want to kill yourself
2016-06-22 10:17:22	mathu	akaseki: it's as if nobody even tries to use C# with anything other than the MS stack
2016-06-22 10:17:31	Fenderbassist	davic: some of the harder edged girls I dated
2016-06-22 10:17:45	beaky	isnt stackexchagne itself powered by the ms stack
2016-06-22 10:17:47	mathu	akaseki: yeah i rather like the language, i like linq well enough, i like the library APIs, i like the nullable types
2016-06-22 10:17:53	akaseki	mathu, well.. in all honesty, most things in C# don't suck that much.. 
2016-06-22 10:18:07	davic	Fenderbassist: males doing the abusive shit is way woorse
2016-06-22 10:18:39	akaseki	mathu, so you can actually make most things in C# without reaching "situations" as often as with other languages..
2016-06-22 10:19:03	beaky	how do i tell if a gf is abusive
2016-06-22 10:19:06	beaky	or if i am abusive
2016-06-22 10:19:17	Fenderbassist	davic: oh I am sure, I've only seen the lighter side of it, I never went into social services to see the true reality of violent men abusing their families
2016-06-22 10:19:25	beaky	akaseki what kinds of situations do you usually reach
2016-06-22 10:19:32	akaseki	mathu, but it deos have the disadvantages of needing the .net, which drives some people away
2016-06-22 10:19:52	Fenderbassist	davic: I did almost have a Social Worker degree before I changed to Computer Science, right before I got sick, so I only heard the theory, I suppose you've seen friends go through the real deal
2016-06-22 10:20:12	davic	a fucking cooler with google search
2016-06-22 10:20:18	mathu	i'm fine with using the .NET libraries, but, like, say i want to use local (not azure, not federated) active directory as a backing for the identity framework
2016-06-22 10:20:45	davic	mathu: buy this http://www.homedepot.com/p/Samsung-27-9-cu-ft-Family-Hub-4-Door-Flex-French-Door-Refrigerator-in-Stainless-Steel-RF28K9580SR/206955054

2016-06-22 10:21:01	mathu	some fucking how, this isn't a standard module for the framework already
2016-06-22 10:21:12	davic	Fenderbassist: I lived in it
2016-06-22 10:21:13	beaky	i want to fap
2016-06-22 10:21:17	mathu	you wind up needing to reimplement like six classes
2016-06-22 10:21:31	akaseki	beaky, I'm learnign C# now and every time i learn something new, i try to apply it and fuck with it a few ways (based on my exp. fucking with C and C++) 
2016-06-22 10:21:32	Fenderbassist	davic: my regrets, you've experienced a whole level beyond my understanding

2016-06-23 19:16:56	theholyduck	once i cast my vote. nobody should be able to compell me to reveal what i voted

2016-06-23 19:19:50	theholyduck	and we hold a vote and 30 people vote
2016-06-23 19:19:59	theholyduck	i bribed 15 of them to vote for me and i also voted for myself.
2016-06-23 19:20:19	stallmen2	i wouldnt vote for you

2016-06-23 19:20:35	Smeef	Even is paper ballot elections, there are disadvantages. I've seen national elections (not in the U.S.) where ballot boxes have gone missing, and months later, completely different ballot boxes that no one even knew were missing were fished out of a river.
2016-06-23 19:20:39	Smeef	in*
2016-06-23 19:20:47	theholyduck	Smeef: yes. it happens
2016-06-23 19:20:54	theholyduck	but attacks on physical baloting scales really poorly
2016-06-23 19:21:05	theholyduck	where as with a digital flaw
2016-06-23 19:21:07	theholyduck	it scales really well
2016-06-23 19:21:20	theholyduck	amigojapan: thus in a normal ellection
2016-06-23 19:21:24	mathu	theholyduck: the anonymous part is easy
2016-06-23 19:21:35	mathu	theholyduck: the "protect against nationstate attackers" is the hard problem
2016-06-23 19:21:37	theholyduck	mathu: yes. but then its impossible to verify if somebody hacked the server
2016-06-23 19:21:44	theholyduck	unless its not anonymous
2016-06-23 19:21:45	mathu	theholyduck: no it isn't
2016-06-23 19:22:02	theholyduck	mathu: how would you verify the vote had been tampered with
2016-06-23 19:22:07	theholyduck	if the vote is anonymous?
2016-06-23 19:22:20	theholyduck	you are basicly putting 100% trust in a computer program at that point
2016-06-23 19:22:30	mathu	i can't spitball this because i'm not equipped to defend against a nationstate adversary
2016-06-23 19:22:33	theholyduck	im not comfortable with that.
2016-06-23 19:22:44	amigojapan	theholyduck: so you are saying that if there is an online vote, people will go and force people at gunpoint to vote for them or something?
2016-06-23 19:22:56	theholyduck	amigojapan: well no. but that was a problem with elections in the past
2016-06-23 19:23:00	theholyduck	which is why elections became anymous
2016-06-23 19:23:00	mathu	but i believe you can approach the same confidence levels as paper ballot boxes with a digital system
2016-06-23 19:23:11	theholyduck	mathu:  well the advantage of paper ballot boxes
2016-06-23 19:23:14	theholyduck	even if they can be manipulated
2016-06-23 19:23:19	theholyduck	is that attacks against them scale really poorly
2016-06-23 19:23:27	theholyduck	you only need to hack 1 central counting server
2016-06-23 19:23:37	theholyduck	trying to steal 500 ballot boxes
2016-06-23 19:23:42	theholyduck	the size of the conspiracy would have to be fucking massive
2016-06-23 19:23:44	amigojapan	theholyduck: I think elections are anonymous so you can vote for whomever you want,  even if people tell you to vote for someone else
2016-06-23 19:23:52	theholyduck	amigojapan: thats also part of it
2016-06-23 19:24:03	theholyduck	amigojapan:  theres several good reasons for them to be anonymous
2016-06-23 19:24:03	Smeef	not that I support electronic voting, just that the whole scaling poorly argument doesn't take into account groups of VERY determined people with sufficient resources. I mean, if the voting is anonymous, and chain of custody of the ballots is the only thing maintaining voter confidence in the system, then it's VERY easy to rig an election, especially in smaller countries

2016-06-23 19:26:27	theholyduck	where as a army of chinese hackers. sitting in china.
2016-06-23 19:26:42	theholyduck	with 1 or 2 inside agents maybe
2016-06-23 19:26:48	theholyduck	could corrupt a digital election
2016-06-23 19:26:49	dblng	theholyduck: you only need five supreme court justices
2016-06-23 19:26:53	dblng	to suppress a recount
2016-06-23 19:26:55	amigojapan	theholyduck: using punchcards seems like hte best of both worlds,   it can be ocunted both electronically and leaves a paper trail
2016-06-23 19:26:56	theholyduck	and the odds of being discovered are WAY less.
2016-06-23 19:27:00	Smeef	mathu, I used to work for the board of elections in New York, and I'd rather not disclose the second country, but it's a very small one that most people don't give a shit about, lol
2016-06-23 19:27:09	theholyduck	amigojapan: yeah. im fine with that
2016-06-23 19:27:10	mathu	dblng: you can't really recount digital votes

2016-06-23 19:27:38	mathu	Smeef: interesting
2016-06-23 19:27:43	theholyduck	attacks against digital voting scales way better
2016-06-23 19:27:47	theholyduck	than attacks against physical voting
2016-06-23 19:28:02	theholyduck	nobody is saying its impossible to attack physical voting
2016-06-23 19:28:08	theholyduck	but most attacks against it have known defences
2016-06-23 19:28:09	Smeef	theholyduck, you don't have to convince me of anything, like I said, I already agree that electronic voting is a bad idea, just pointing out that regualr voting now is also pretty shitty
2016-06-23 19:28:19	theholyduck	Smeef: oh i agree on that part
2016-06-23 19:28:22	theholyduck	regular voting could be better
2016-06-23 19:28:29	theholyduck	but anyone who argues for instituting electronic voting of any kind

2016-06-24 14:57:40	pteague	about a month ago i found over $300 in my desk still at my parents house ... they bought the desk for me back in high school & it never got moved out of my old room ... they've been putting a bunch of their own stuff in it so i wasn't sure if it was mine (i've stashed cash everywhere over the years) or if it was theirs so i asked if they knew anything about it ... my mom thought i might be asking about the collectible coins she'd been hiding so she 
2016-06-24 14:57:40	pteague	went & looked first ... then asked my dad ... neither of them knew anything about the cash ...
2016-06-24 14:57:46	pteague	always hide cash for a rainy day ...
2016-06-24 14:57:52	pteague	preferably in stashes you remember about & are better well hidden ... or in stashes you keep near you ... or so well hidden nobody finds ...
2016-06-24 14:59:04	pteague	unfortunately i was consuming my local stash of cash at the vending machine at my last job ... i should have got extra cash for that ... because i just have enough to get gas tonight :(

2016-06-24 17:40:29	bagelsan	Sasazuka, people think it will bring about change to various aspects of life in the uk which they deem as presently negative. but with the change it will reverse these things. ( maybe. maybe not. probably not. )
2016-06-24 17:40:57	Sasazuka	so they believe EU had a negative impact on their way of life
2016-06-24 17:41:41	bagelsan	Sasazuka, eu has a bunch of restrictions on stuff

2016-06-24 17:58:24	beaky	ye isnt the eu in facing a crisis of their own to worry about the uk leaving
2016-06-24 17:58:41	theholyduck	beaky: maybe. 
2016-06-24 17:58:46	Sasazuka	so UK leaving is a valid reason to go to war for?
2016-06-24 17:59:04	theholyduck	Sasazuka: anything is a valid reason to go to war for
2016-06-24 17:59:08	theholyduck	as long as you can sell your population on it

2016-06-24 17:59:45	Sasazuka	like a peace treaty, if you violate a term it would be a valid reason for war is what I meant
2016-06-24 18:00:01	Sasazuka	theholyduck: only the dumb states though
2016-06-24 18:00:04	beaky	stallmen utsu musume sayuri
2016-06-24 18:00:04	theholyduck	Sasazuka: theres no such thing as a "valid reason for war" .
2016-06-24 18:00:22	theholyduck	Sasazuka: im just saying
2016-06-24 18:00:28	Sasazuka	I would say violating a peace treaty is pretty valid
2016-06-24 18:00:30	theholyduck	the only real way the eu has of preventing the uk from leaving
2016-06-24 18:00:31	theholyduck	is war.
2016-06-24 18:00:39	theholyduck	and that wont happen
2016-06-24 18:00:43	theholyduck	therefore theres nothing the eu can do

2016-06-24 18:00:51	stallmen	beaky, you don't rewatch anime?
2016-06-24 18:00:52	theholyduck	depending on how it goes in the uk.

2016-06-24 18:01:20	theholyduck	Sasazuka: not really no. but they would lose all the benefits aswwell.
2016-06-24 18:01:53	theholyduck	so. odds are something will be negotiated i think
2016-06-24 18:02:01	theholyduck	Sasazuka: like norway is not part of the EU
2016-06-24 18:02:09	theholyduck	but wwe still have a free trade agreement
2016-06-24 18:02:12	theholyduck	with all of the eu
2016-06-24 18:02:23	theholyduck	to keep that free trade agreement. we have certain obligations
2016-06-24 18:03:38	beaky	is it a bad thing to leave the eu

2016-06-24 19:16:26	Artemis-kun	for the most part, immigration

2016-06-24 19:16:40	Faikau	They don't want immigration?

2016-06-24 19:17:18	Faikau	Hmm, in a lot o ways.
2016-06-24 19:17:23	Artemis-kun	beyond that, control of the country instead of bowing to brussels, and opting out of all the EU trade laws
2016-06-24 19:17:25	Faikau	UK is like the US.
2016-06-24 19:17:48	Artemis-kun	that's the impression they've given the world following this nonsense
2016-06-24 19:18:11	stallmen	Artemis-kun, 
2016-06-24 19:18:33	Artemis-kun	the funniest part is that hours after the polls closed, there was a surge in searches related to "what happens if we leave the EU"
2016-06-24 19:18:49	Artemis-kun	so, apparently people just voted blindly
2016-06-24 19:18:53	Illya	well yeah
2016-06-24 19:18:58	Illya	people are clueless
2016-06-24 19:19:02	Artemis-kun	indeed
2016-06-24 19:19:10	Illya	I would have voted leave tho
2016-06-24 19:19:19	Artemis-kun	I'm not even british, and I feel like I had a better grasp of the situation 
2016-06-24 19:19:20	Faikau	I've always thought the british were cool.
2016-06-24 19:19:34	Illya	>inb4 "now, not so much"
2016-06-24 19:19:50	Illya	it was pretty much 1:1 tho
2016-06-24 19:19:53	Faikau	I'm sincere.
2016-06-24 19:20:05	Artemis-kun	I mean, the first thing that came to mind once I learned exactly what brexit was about was 'this is gonna be a shitstorm for their economy'
2016-06-24 19:20:16	Fenderbassist	By leaving the EU, they no longer have to open their borders to anyone that entered any other part of the EU (is my understanding)
2016-06-24 19:20:21	Faikau	I was more concerned about the prime minister leaving.
2016-06-24 19:20:48	Faikau	Sounds like independence.

2016-06-24 19:22:07	Artemis-kun	well, see, the funny twist to the situation is that if they even wish to participate in the EU market at all, they'll still have to abide by the vast majority of the things they wanted to accomplish by leaving the EU in the first place, including open borders and EU trade laws
2016-06-24 19:22:28	Artemis-kun	the biggest selling point about leaving the EU turned out to be a massive lie, which was topkek
2016-06-24 19:22:47	Artemis-kun	which was the supposed 350 million they pay to the EU each month
2016-06-24 19:22:56	Artemis-kun	that was supposed to instead end up going to health care
2016-06-24 19:23:05	Artemis-kun	buuuuuuut turns out that that money can't go there anyway
2016-06-24 19:23:08	Fenderbassist	Artemis-kun: I see, I 'm still learning about the situation so that is interesting to hear
2016-06-24 19:23:55	Artemis-kun	I've been reading about the fallout all day long, mostly because the company I work for has offices and clients in the UK, so we're somewhat concerned about what this is going to end up meaning for us

2016-06-24 19:25:51	microcolonel	Faikau: Well, The difference between the UK and US desires is that the U.S. has decent functioning immigration law, but it's not enforced; so they want to enforce it. The UK is different in that they don't want the dysfunctional immigration law the EC has been saying they'll impose.

2016-06-24 19:31:42	theholyduck	the 350 million pounds figure
2016-06-24 19:31:44	theholyduck	is bullshit
2016-06-24 19:31:52	Artemis-kun	yeah, I assumed that much about it
2016-06-24 19:31:55	theholyduck	they pay 350 million out
2016-06-24 19:32:01	theholyduck	but they get a lot back
2016-06-24 19:32:12	theholyduck	so its actually like 200 million or 150 or something
2016-06-24 19:32:32	Artemis-kun	I just was under the impression that the promise seemed to be that that would be happening, and the fact that it wasn't going to happen was a huge fail
2016-06-24 19:32:54	Artemis-kun	and that the leave campaign made a big deal about getting all of that money to health care
2016-06-24 19:33:01	Artemis-kun	still, the whole situation is absolutely mad
2016-06-24 19:33:07	theholyduck	ok. i checked. the actual cost to the uk a week
2016-06-24 19:33:10	theholyduck	is 190 million gbp
2016-06-24 19:33:25	bagelsan	theholyduck, i told you that
2016-06-24 19:33:27	theholyduck	they pay out 350 million. get back 160

2016-06-24 19:34:38	theholyduck	so it was always bullshit.
2016-06-24 19:34:54	Artemis-kun	that's more or less what I understood about things

2016-06-24 19:36:55	Artemis-kun	that's pretty much my assessment of things
2016-06-24 19:37:11	theholyduck	but they would probably have to pay like 190 million gbp a week
2016-06-24 19:37:13	theholyduck	to be part of that

2016-06-25 13:13:11	hassoon	amigojapan: friendliness and easiness to get along with males
2016-06-25 13:13:54	amigojapan	hassoon: hmmm,   they are famous for being friendly until you marry them and then changing 180degrees,    but it is probably not all of them

2016-06-25 13:14:10	amigojapan	yup

2016-06-25 23:36:58	bagelsan	KaffeeJunky123, i never buy that shit
2016-06-25 23:37:10	KaffeeJunky123	People buy stuff like optical improvements for their characters and that's what keeps the games running
2016-06-25 23:37:25	KaffeeJunky123	So they can make the actual game free to play
2016-06-25 23:37:50	KaffeeJunky123	Often brings in much more cash than charging for a game
2016-06-25 23:38:14	KaffeeJunky123	amigojapan: ofcourse it also has its downsides from the player perspective

2016-06-25 23:55:22	Fenderbassist	amigojapan:  reminds me of Cowboy Bebop where even restaurants had electronic ordering
2016-06-25 23:55:36	TsundereNoises	Fenderbassist: yeah, it's nice because you can make lots of really different soups, but most are very cost effective
2016-06-25 23:56:08	Fenderbassist	TsundereNoises: I've done it with lentil, real vegetable broth, various kinds of beans, tomatoes, etc
2016-06-25 23:56:19	Fenderbassist	TsundereNoises: I will think about that next time I go shopping, ty

2016-06-28 18:54:59	Shinra	:)
2016-06-28 18:55:15	MadokaMagica	I hope Sephiroth stabs you all
2016-06-28 18:55:18	Urchin	yes, we should look back on injustices of feudalism!
2016-06-28 18:55:23	Terminus	i kinda want to play FF7 but i'm torn because historically FF7 has always felt grindy to me.
2016-06-28 18:55:27	KaffeeJunky123	I liked Ballmer
2016-06-28 18:55:33	KaffeeJunky123	He was entertaining

2016-06-28 18:56:10	MadokaMagica	There were way too many between save points

2016-06-28 18:57:07	MadokaMagica	And I need to know what all the games from Smash 4 characters are like
2016-06-28 18:57:13	MadokaMagica	So I can enjoy Smash 4 better
2016-06-28 18:57:41	Shinra	FFVII is flawed in a ton of ways of course

2016-06-28 19:07:39	MadokaMagica	I'm worried
2016-06-28 19:07:42	Shinra	Oh I remember
2016-06-28 19:07:48	Shinra	fury makes your limit gauge build faster
2016-06-28 19:08:01	MadokaMagica	How do you get them?
2016-06-28 19:08:08	Shinra	sadness makes it build slower
2016-06-28 19:08:28	Shinra	I believe you can give a healthy party member a Hyper
2016-06-28 19:08:34	Shinra	and they'll get Fury status from it
2016-06-28 19:08:43	MadokaMagica	Oh, Tifa just randomly got Sadness
2016-06-28 19:08:49	MadokaMagica	Turns out it half the speed you build limit gauge

2016-06-28 19:10:03	Shinra	more times you do them, more new and more powerful ones you unlock
2016-06-28 19:10:07	Shinra	so fury is good for that

2016-06-28 19:10:29	MadokaMagica	Tifa's has that lottery and doesn't deal much damage even with two "Yeah!"'s
2016-06-28 19:10:40	Shinra	lol yeah

2016-06-28 19:11:06	Shinra	actually one of the most powerful in the game due it dealing multiple 9999s

2016-06-28 19:11:31	Shinra	get chocobo, cross swamp
2016-06-28 19:11:32	MadokaMagica	Other than "probably through the swamp with the Midgard Serpeant in it"
2016-06-28 19:11:35	Shinra	avoid giant snek
2016-06-28 19:11:39	MadokaMagica	What then?
2016-06-28 19:11:45	Shinra	go through cave

2016-06-29 14:48:05	unicornjedi	YetiMaster5000, wear it
2016-06-29 14:48:15	IceFireXD	btw.... if you're a gamer, you should dumpster dive gamestop dumpsters. it's store policy to throw out like.... half the stuff they get back, and normally they're supposed to destroy it, but the actual people get lazy and don't bother.
2016-06-29 14:48:18	YetiMaster5000	I don't like jewelry all that much.
2016-06-29 14:48:32	IceFireXD	so they'll throw away fully functioning systems, games, controllers, headsets, and stuff like that

2016-06-29 14:49:23	ezekielnoob	are you into some choker?
2016-06-29 14:49:29	YetiMaster5000	What
2016-06-29 14:49:33	IceFireXD	ezekielnoob: many places want staff to take home food left at the end of the day because it'd go to waste otherwise.
2016-06-29 14:50:11	ezekielnoob	however what the company said is that it can be a conflict of interest
2016-06-29 14:50:15	unicornjedi	IceFireXD, for real? omg ill do that
2016-06-29 14:50:36	ezekielnoob	it said it can motivate the workers to not sell all the food
2016-06-29 14:51:03	ezekielnoob	not sure about taht
2016-06-29 14:51:04	unicornjedi	ezekielnoob, lame. people already dont care about selling anything if they get paid 10$hr
2016-06-29 14:51:06	IceFireXD	unicornjedi: just be aware that most gamestop locations have their dumpsters in a locked enclosure, and some even have cameras watching over them.
2016-06-29 14:51:22	unicornjedi	IceFireXD, omg... so lame
2016-06-29 14:51:25	IceFireXD	it's dumb as fuck, but some places even go to the extreme of calling the cops on dumpster diving.

2016-06-29 19:06:11	microcolonel	Smeef: yeah, it's about a startup which has a lossless compression breakthrough which is miraculously applicable to everything from video to audio to generic data.
2016-06-29 19:06:15	Smeef	thought it was the big bang theory for IT people and without the laugh track
2016-06-29 19:06:17	Illya	it's like trying to be a meme but it's not meme-ing hard enough so it's kinda not funny but it tries so its bad

2016-06-29 19:08:51	KaffeeJunky123	Sasazuka: and he was there to be out of place, to create an atmosphere of awkwardness

2016-06-29 19:09:00	KaffeeJunky123	And because "Hey it's a star!"
2016-06-29 19:09:04	Sasazuka	having Kid Rock wasn't meant to be a bragging point
2016-06-29 19:09:13	Shinra	It's just a saying

2016-06-29 22:17:30	kosan	And this was a time when MC servers didn't auto-save as often as we needed, so I made it run the save command every so often as well.

2016-06-29 22:57:30	Smeef	for example, my dad recently sold some property in a foreign country, using his brother as an intermediary, the considerable sum of money that belongs to my father is sitting in my uncle's bank account right now (mind you, his siblings have literally bribed people in order to steal land from my father before).

2016-06-29 22:57:31	Smeef	account, either mine or my sister's or my mother's, since the interest alone is a huge deal. My father's response was "I don't believe in interest."

2016-06-29 23:27:59	beaky	or baka
2016-06-29 23:28:00	justanotheruser	'teaky'
2016-06-29 23:28:02	crutchy	Nanobot, pretty soon the word 'woman' will need to be changed too. cos it has 'man' in it
2016-06-29 23:28:09	SailorHaumea	lol crutchy
2016-06-29 23:28:20	Nanobot	Like, when somebody does something that clearly demonstrates unawareness of everything
2016-06-29 23:28:32	crutchy	oblivious
2016-06-29 23:28:39	beaky	naive?
2016-06-29 23:28:48	beaky	oblivious is more liek it

2016-06-29 23:29:12	crutchy	Nanobot, 'stupid' fits in there quite nicely :p
2016-06-29 23:29:15	pyon	Nanobot: stupid... or perhaps bad
2016-06-29 23:29:34	Nanobot	Stupid doesn't quite capture the aloofness
2016-06-29 23:29:39	crutchy	oh but the word 'stupid' might be oppresive too
2016-06-29 23:29:49	beaky	'brilliant'
2016-06-29 23:29:58	beaky	in the most sarcastic tone
2016-06-29 23:30:10	Nanobot	And dumbass sounds too confrontational
2016-06-29 23:30:21	pyon	Nanobot: “aloof” as in “not in touch with the rest of the world”?

2016-06-29 23:30:59	pyon	I've previously seen the term “aloof” used without any negative connotation.
2016-06-29 23:31:16	pyon	e.g., to describe Nagato Yuki
2016-06-29 23:31:16	Nanobot	Yeah. So aloof doesn't work either
2016-06-29 23:31:32	Nanobot	Honestly, I say "retarded" because that's simply the best word to convey what I mean
2016-06-29 23:31:34	pyon	Why deprive yourself of the word “retarded” anyway?
2016-06-29 23:31:47	Nanobot	And nobody uses "retarded" to refer to mentally handicapped people anymore
2016-06-29 23:31:56	Nanobot	pyon: It was a thing yesterday
2016-06-29 23:32:01	pyon	:-O
2016-06-29 23:32:07	Nanobot	I called something retarded, and people scolded me
2016-06-29 23:32:08	pyon	Nanobot: Where? At your workplace?
2016-06-29 23:32:11	Nanobot	Here
2016-06-29 23:32:13	pyon	Oh.
2016-06-29 23:32:14	crutchy	yeah its like 'gay' used to mean happy. now it means retarded
2016-06-29 23:32:30	pyon	That's pretty gay.
2016-06-29 23:32:35	crutchy	:p
2016-06-29 23:32:45	Nanobot	But people still use "gay" to refer to homosexuals all the time. I've never heard someone actually called a mentally handicapped person a retard IRL
2016-06-29 23:33:24	Nanobot	retard always refers to something who *should* know better, but they're just being a retard
2016-06-29 23:33:29	Nanobot	*someone
2016-06-29 23:33:30	pyon	Yup.
2016-06-29 23:33:37	crutchy	maybe the lgbt movement ought to protest to ban the word gay to describe monosexuals
2016-06-29 23:33:44	pyon	Nanobot: At least that's how I've seen the term consistently used as well.
2016-06-29 23:33:49	crutchy	then we could use gay for an insult without prejudice

2016-06-30 00:15:47	Smeef	At some point we're gonna hit a wall of what people can do physically and mentally, and records are just gonna stop being broken. Then the question becomes how much help will a person need in terms of chemical, material, biological, or mechanical augmentation to push the envelope 
2016-06-30 00:15:49	KaffeeJunky123	actually that was random bullshit Jakmodii

2016-06-30 00:19:05	KaffeeJunky123	Jakmodii: don't think it works that way 
2016-06-30 00:19:06	Jakmodii	What slow service

2016-06-30 00:35:32	pyon	now that i think about it, one way to deal with loud neighbors is to shame them online

2016-06-30 00:35:46	Jakmodii	shaming people online is the new social control

2016-06-30 00:39:24	Smeef	it's like a self fulfilling prophecy, they see you filming them as a precaution in the event of a backlash, and they immediately proceed to commence the lashing of backs
2016-06-30 00:41:27	Jakmodii	So what inputs are required to the plant for the desired output to offset the initial input. Enter control theory yayyyy my favorite

2016-06-30 00:59:20	TsundereNoises	Anyway, talking friends into covering their expenses is good training for future musicians until they make it big

2016-06-30 19:52:42	KaffeeJunky123	the inflamation was probably caused by antibiotics mostly
2016-06-30 19:53:09	KaffeeJunky123	had to take them pretty often because of tonsils and sinuses
2016-06-30 19:54:13	KaffeeJunky123	I had an incredible amount of bacterial infections in my childhood

2016-06-30 22:37:28	SailorHaumea	Geert Adriaans Boomgaard, born September 21, 1788, died on February 3, 1899 aged 110 years, 135 days. A Dutchman, he served in the Grand Armee of Napoleon, married twice, and outlived all twelve? (I think he had twelve) of his kids.
2016-06-30 22:38:03	Fenderbassist	SailorHaumea: wow
2016-06-30 22:38:07	GeneralVagueness	while that's impressive, it sounds kind of shitty too
2016-06-30 22:38:15	SailorHaumea	 Mr. Boomgaard was quite the stubborn man; while living in the "Jacob en Anna Gasthuis" (a retirement home for the elderly), he once was not happy with the food he received there - rice, imported from the then Dutch colony Indonesia. When Mr. Boomgaard got his way and received potatoes, yet still complained about those, he was reprimanded for his behaviour, despite being well in his 90s.
2016-06-30 22:38:32	GeneralVagueness	outliving your kids and just barely missing seeing three different centuries
2016-06-30 22:38:45	Fenderbassist	GeneralVagueness: good point
2016-06-30 22:38:51	SailorHaumea	GeneralVagueness: He was almost two years away.
2016-06-30 22:39:01	SailorHaumea	The 20th century started in 1901.
2016-06-30 22:39:03	GeneralVagueness	two years isn't much compared to 110
2016-06-30 22:39:08	SailorHaumea	Because of no year 0.
2016-06-30 22:39:19	SailorHaumea	So the 1st century = 1-100, etc.

2016-06-30 22:41:06	SailorHaumea	Boomgaard's age record was later broken by Guernsey woman Marguerite "Margaret" Ann Neve (née Harvey), who was born May 18, 1792 and died April 4, 1903, aged 110 years, 321 days.
2016-06-30 22:41:58	SailorHaumea	 As a child, Neve survived a fall down the stairs, which left her concussed for three days. Neve could remember the turmoil that the French Revolution brought to Guernsey. In 1807, Neve set sail for Weymouth with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at Chesil Beach. She was educated in Bristol, England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry.
2016-06-30 22:42:15	SailorHaumea	Neve met with Charles François Dumouriez, a general of the French Revolutionary Wars, who dubbed her "la spirituelle". She married John Neve in St. Peter Port, Guernsey on 18 January 1823 and took up residence in England, but returned to Guernsey in 1849 after he committed suicide.
2016-06-30 22:42:29	SailorHaumea	Neve travelled abroad to various countries with her sister, who died aged 98. Their last trip was in 1872, when they visited Krakow (then in Austria-Hungary, now in Poland). Her mother lived to the age of 99. She was the oldest living person before her death at age 110 years 321 days. Margaret died peacefully on 4 April 1903. She was one of the few people to have lived during the 18th century, 19th century, and the 20th century.

2016-06-30 22:44:45	SailorHaumea	The person who surpassed Neve's record was American woman Louisa Kirwan Thiers (née Capron), born October 2, 1814 and died February 17, 1926, aged 111 years, 138 days. Her family was well-off - she was a daughter of a Revolutionary War veteran, and if I'm not mistaken, her father was an adviser to George Washington.
2016-06-30 22:45:39	Danny_ka	I wonder for how long will people of this century live

2016-06-30 22:46:58	SailorHaumea	Seth Capron (1762-1835) enlisted, 1780, in Capt. Simon Larned's company, Col. William Shepard's regiment, New York Line, and afterwards was aide-de-camp to General Washington. He was born in Attleborough, Mass.; died in Walden, N. Y.

2016-06-30 22:48:48	SailorHaumea	Thiers didn't retain the title of "oldest person ever" for very long...another American woman broken her record later in 1926.
2016-06-30 22:51:10	SailorHaumea	The woman in question was Adelia Delina Filkins (née Ecker), who went by Delina. She was born on May 4, 1815 and died on December 4, 1928, aged 113 years, 214 days. She lived most of her life in Stark, New York.

2016-06-30 22:53:47	SailorHaumea	For years, Filkins remained the longest-lived person ever recorded, as others over the years gave their best shots at surpassing the record.

2016-06-30 22:55:47	SailorHaumea	Nancy E. Merriman (née Mitchell) was born on December 19, 1841 and died on January 14, 1954, aged 112 years, 26 days. She was black, but was never a slave - she lived in Illinois.
2016-06-30 22:57:43	SailorHaumea	Next up to bat was Betsy Ann Baker (née Russell) a British-American woman who was closer to the record age-wise...but not close enough. Born August 20, 1842 in England, she died October 24, 1955 in Tecumseh, Nebraska, aged 113 years, 65 days.

2016-06-30 23:00:15	SailorHaumea	And then came a really close miss. Mary Martha Kelly (née Young), born June 7, 1851 in Michigan, she died December 30, 1964 in California, aged 113 years, 206 days...8 days shy of Filkins's record.

2016-06-30 23:06:50	SailorHaumea	Filkins and Kelly remained the two oldest ever for 15 years. Then, in 1979, Eliza Jane Underwood (née Brown), born March 15, 1866, broke Kelly's record, and 9 days later surpassed Filkins to become the oldest ever. But there were two women trailing Underwood. Fannie Leona Thomas (born April 24, 1867) and Anna Maude Murphy (née Fahey) (born April 25, 1867) were trailing,
2016-06-30 23:07:52	Danny_ka	koromo, Keanu Reeves (1567 — our days)
2016-06-30 23:08:02	SailorHaumea	as were Constance Alicia Blanchet (née Reaux), born June 8, 1867, and Hattie Lorena Stone (née Lloyd), born August 17, 1867.
2016-06-30 23:09:27	SailorHaumea	Blanchet was the first of the five to pass, on November 9, 1979, aged 112 years, 154 days. Then went Stone, on January 13, 1980 aged 112 years, 149 days. Then we lost Murphy on December 22, 1980, aged 113 years, 242 days.

2016-06-30 23:12:57	SailorHaumea	Five years passed. And then, Polish-American woman Augusta Louise Holtz (née Hoppe), born August 3, 1871. She died in Missouri on October 21, 1986, aged 115 years, 79 days.
2016-06-30 23:14:38	SailorHaumea	And then the record was smashed by a long shot, by Jeanne Louise Calment of France. Born February 21, 1875. She reached birthday after birthday...116, 117, 118...each time making witty remarks at her parties. On August 4, 197, aged 122 years, 164 days.
2016-06-30 23:14:49	SailorHaumea	Calment still is the oldest ever.
2016-06-30 23:15:10	SailorHaumea	Meanwhile, as for Americans....
2016-06-30 23:16:11	SailorHaumea	koromo: The US record is held by Sarah DeRemer "Sadie" Knauss (née Clark), born September 24, 1880 and died December 30, 1999, aged 119 years, 97 days.

2016-06-30 23:58:18	KaffeeJunky123	I was hesitating, cause I feared I might got it mixed up with Hanna Montana
2016-06-30 23:58:46	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: did you just compose that song and it already has 1.1m views?
2016-06-30 23:58:56	unicornjedi	Fenderbassist, excellent

2016-06-30 23:59:09	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: I wish, I never had talent composing, only listening
2016-06-30 23:59:27	KaffeeJunky123	Fenderbassist: composing isn't about talent, it's obsession
2016-06-30 23:59:38	KaffeeJunky123	and that's what people call talent
2016-06-30 23:59:41	Fenderbassist	KaffeeJunky123: then I lacked that form of obsession :)
2016-06-30 23:59:42	unicornjedi	Fenderbassist, !!! thats awesome! I still havent been to my first concert. I don't think that club thing counts
2016-06-30 23:59:52	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: the club thing counts
2016-07-01 00:00:01	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: a performance is a performance is a performance

2016-07-03 23:33:31	exio4	that's not as cool
2016-07-03 23:33:45	LadyElusive	pyon, you really shouldn't compare all anime to all other anime in such a linear fashion
2016-07-03 23:33:53	LadyElusive	it's bad categorization

2016-07-04 12:52:45	theholyduck	not that much alcohol
2016-07-04 12:52:54	Fenderbassist	hassoon: When you inhale alcohol, the body isn't able to use one of its natural protections from alcohol poisoning -- vomiting. Because alcohol does not go through your stomach during inhalation, excessive amounts will not trigger nausea. Also, while you can physically see how much you are drinking, it's tough to tell how much alcohol you are consuming when taking it in through vapor. 
2016-07-04 12:53:03	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: dude, my friends were talking bout triple essence shift in LoD. I told them that I was the one who made them. Didn't believe me. Proved it. Became god.

2016-07-04 12:53:48	Fenderbassist	theholyduck: On the surface, smoked alcohol may seem attractive to users. None of the alcohol is metabolized by the stomach, and it goes directly to the brain and bloodstream. This results in a shorter, but faster feeling of intoxication.

2016-07-04 14:06:23	Fenderbassist	pyon: he's probably powerless/disappointed/disconnected in real life, and it can be human nature to spend more energy avoiding a problem than it takes to fix it
2016-07-04 14:06:51	pyon	That's... his problem. I don't see why any of us here should care.
2016-07-04 14:06:57	Fenderbassist	pyon: people sometimes decide something is so, therefore it cannot be changed

2016-07-04 14:22:08	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: so I just dropped it and moved on
2016-07-04 14:22:08	kosan	I should probably be getting ready to head out, but that involves tearing down my computer -.-

2016-07-04 14:25:42	unicornjedi	kosan: should I see it?\
2016-07-04 14:26:10	unicornjedi	kosan: the disappearance of nagato?
2016-07-04 14:26:52	kosan	unicornjedi: I honestly enjoyed it, despite not being a fan of the whole story. Not for poor writing, mind. I'm salty for my own reasons.

2016-07-04 14:36:34	kosan	It popped up... Somewhere? Looked interesting enough to drop into my 'plan to watch' queue, a lot of which I'll probably never actually watch. *shrug*
2016-07-04 14:37:00	kosan	I think I found it via a scene snipped out for some meme video somewhere. Which is amusingly how I find a lot of shows.
2016-07-04 14:37:33	unicornjedi	kosan: lol thats how I found My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. I am excited to see the movie in 2017

2016-07-04 14:51:18	amigojapan	unicornjedi: I suspect that if we ran an experiment, and put regular people on an annonymous chat for a while, we would find that many of them would degenerate to trolls if they knew they could not be traced and it was annonymous.... it would be an interesting social experiment to run

2016-07-04 14:52:54	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: ah well you must realize that the more aggressive the troll is, the more powerless they are in real life and are pretty angry about it
2016-07-04 14:53:13	amigojapan	unicornjedi: how do we get regular people to join chat?  that is hte key ingredient in the experiment

2016-07-04 14:53:19	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: they need to act like they have power online because they felt let down by life

2016-07-04 14:57:55	Fenderbassist	amigojapan: you could conduct a double blind study....put two trolls in their own channel
2016-07-04 14:58:29	amigojapan	unicornjedi: you mean, just make a youtube video asking people to join?  I think that is already a flaw in the experiment, cause youtube people are alreayd involved in troll fights on the youtube comments section
2016-07-04 14:59:28	amigojapan	unicornjedi: prefferably we need people that never used the internet before... 
2016-07-04 14:59:56	Animeconnoisseur	Youtube people are the bottom of the barrel
2016-07-04 15:00:18	amigojapan	unicornjedi: then we need to let them meet in real life, and see that nobody is aggressive and everyone behaves properly....  then the experiment can start

2016-07-04 18:26:46	IceFireXD	when The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim came out, i got it at a midnight release....
2016-07-04 18:26:58	unicornjedi	Fenderbassist: idk where is bagelsan. I think hes depressed rn
2016-07-04 18:26:59	Shinra	was it fulfilling?
2016-07-04 18:27:14	IceFireXD	in the 168 hours (7 days) after getting it, i logged 140 hours on the game.
2016-07-04 18:27:19	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: if he drank and did pills, he will be

2016-07-04 18:28:10	Shinra	I just didn't like it
2016-07-04 18:28:22	beaky	i like skyrim
2016-07-04 18:28:23	IceFireXD	what didn't you like about it?
2016-07-04 18:28:30	Shinra	It wasn't morrowind
2016-07-04 18:28:41	IceFireXD	morrowind is the most broken of the 3.
2016-07-04 18:28:47	Shinra	It's my favourite
2016-07-04 18:29:02	Shinra	the games declined steadily since then for me
2016-07-04 18:29:03	IceFireXD	make no mistake, i love morrowind, but there was SOOOO much about it that's borked
2016-07-04 18:29:26	IceFireXD	i mean.... the world record speed run for completing the game is just 7 minutes if you include the character creation!
2016-07-04 18:29:27	unicornjedi	Fenderbassist: I hope hes okay

2016-07-04 18:42:15	IceFireXD	Fenderbassist: it kinda is....
2016-07-04 18:42:22	IceFireXD	first, the lid seals air tight
2016-07-04 18:42:35	IceFireXD	second, there's enough space in there i could easily fit a magnesium sparker into it
2016-07-04 18:42:57	IceFireXD	and some tissues or napkins or something for kindling to get it started
2016-07-04 18:43:15	IceFireXD	and it's nice thick glass, so it's strong too
2016-07-04 18:43:18	IceFireXD	with a metal cap
2016-07-04 18:43:33	Shinra	a sexy ninja girl has joined my party on Shining Force 3-2
2016-07-04 18:43:35	IceFireXD	and a gasket seal in the cap
2016-07-04 18:44:12	IceFireXD	so, it's basically perfect.... everything to start your fire, and a container to boil water in.
2016-07-04 18:44:33	IceFireXD	i hadn't thought about that before
2016-07-04 18:44:37	IceFireXD	but that's actually pretty cool
2016-07-04 18:45:13	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: yep you can totally do it that way, or just use the bottle as firestarter storage where you pull out sticks as needed to build a regular camp fire
2016-07-04 18:45:29	IceFireXD	and actually, since you wouldn't need to burn all the sticks, it could actually work to start 5-10 fires, instead of just one.
2016-07-04 18:45:31	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: I have a kit like that, myself, different material
2016-07-04 18:47:06	IceFireXD	with a magnesium sparker and something to easily turn the sparks into flame (tissue/napkin), the popsicle sticks would just provide the starting burning material. over the fire you would lay 'wet' wood, and it would start to burn that as the popsicle sticks finish burning
2016-07-04 18:47:40	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: yep, that is the traditional routine, you sound all set up for it too
2016-07-04 18:47:46	IceFireXD	if by "build a regular camp fire", you mean using an accelerant and matches/lighter.... that's more a barbeque fire than a camp fire.
2016-07-04 18:47:56	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: no
2016-07-04 18:48:07	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: I'm talking about building a camp fire like you would in the 1800s
2016-07-04 18:48:13	IceFireXD	well...
2016-07-04 18:48:18	IceFireXD	maybe not quite that far back
2016-07-04 18:48:24	IceFireXD	not sure magnesium sparkers were a thing then
2016-07-04 18:48:47	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: you take your hatchet, find dead wood, split it, find tree bark or bush material, grab your steel and flint....
2016-07-04 18:48:55	beaky	i love wood
2016-07-04 18:48:56	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: you get the idea

2016-07-04 18:49:16	IceFireXD	dried grass or leaves are probably better kindling than tree bark
2016-07-04 18:49:30	IceFireXD	Shinra: nope.
2016-07-04 18:49:32	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: sure if you are in grassy region
2016-07-04 18:49:48	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: but don't discount tree barks, some are the best fire starters when it's rained
2016-07-04 18:49:49	IceFireXD	the gasses that make a fart stinky decompose in normal air. slowly, but they do.
2016-07-04 18:50:05	IceFireXD	Fenderbassist: assuming you have the right type of bark.
2016-07-04 18:50:08	beaky	maybe try pooping in a jar then sealing it as a time pod
2016-07-04 18:50:09	Shinra	that's disappointing

2016-07-04 18:52:02	IceFireXD	i have absolutely no sympathy for those who have that happen to them.
2016-07-04 18:52:13	Fenderbassist	beaky: I wish I knew, he's not been on
2016-07-04 18:52:20	Fenderbassist	oh wow I didn't see that one
2016-07-04 18:52:25	Fenderbassist	I'll have to do that
2016-07-04 18:52:44	IceFireXD	if something is important to you, you protect it.
2016-07-04 18:52:46	Fenderbassist	next time he's on
2016-07-04 18:53:05	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: I agree, it's a big life lesson....choose wisely cause Life has a Great White Shark teeth pattern
2016-07-04 18:53:10	IceFireXD	if you don't protect it adequately, and lose it, it's your own fault. particularly if it's the case that you lost it because you got drunk.
2016-07-04 18:53:14	IceFireXD	then it's doubly your fault.
2016-07-04 18:53:25	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: well yep, and he's struggling with that
2016-07-04 18:53:26	beaky	why steal meds from bagelsan tho
2016-07-04 18:53:34	Fenderbassist	beaky: greed
2016-07-04 18:53:45	IceFireXD	i'd actually like to append what i said
2016-07-04 18:53:47	Shinra	it's what addicts do
2016-07-04 18:53:51	Fenderbassist	beaky: when you're used to drinking and drugs as your mainstay....
2016-07-04 18:53:56	beaky	oh
2016-07-04 18:54:04	beaky	is bagelsan an addict
2016-07-04 18:54:06	IceFireXD	i have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who has something negative happen to them because, or while, they're drunk.
2016-07-04 18:54:09	brainwash	Shinra is a panty sniffer
2016-07-04 18:54:22	Fenderbassist	beaky: yep
2016-07-04 18:54:23	Shinra	only your mom's brainwash 
2016-07-04 18:54:35	beaky	IceFireXD what about drunk rapes
2016-07-04 18:54:37	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: ok, though I think for some that have the genetics for it, not so easy to beat
2016-07-04 18:54:51	brainwash	your mom is so fat
2016-07-04 18:54:54	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: to quote Ozzy Osbourne - Ask anyone with an addiction, Life's a birtch
2016-07-04 18:54:57	Fenderbassist	bitch*
2016-07-04 18:54:58	IceFireXD	getting drunk (excluding being pranked/tricked/trapped) is a decision. choosing to get drunk is choosing to accept ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that happens because of, and during, that time.
2016-07-04 18:55:15	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: that's fine, you can be Mr Rational about it, have you struggled with an addiction?
2016-07-04 18:55:25	hgoel	gotta agree withIceFire there
2016-07-04 18:55:26	brainwash	does anyone here actually help the poor and those who are in need?
2016-07-04 18:55:26	beaky	have you ever struggled with anything beyond your control even while sober
2016-07-04 18:55:28	IceFireXD	yes, alcoholism is an addiction, which is a medical disease.
2016-07-04 18:55:41	IceFireXD	but here's the huge fucking astrisk after that
2016-07-04 18:55:42	brainwash	like giving away meals
2016-07-04 18:55:54	brainwash	or donate old shoes
2016-07-04 18:55:56	Fenderbassist	brainwash: yep
2016-07-04 18:55:59	Fenderbassist	brainwash: plenty of times
2016-07-04 18:56:09	brainwash	you are a cool guy then
2016-07-04 18:56:11	hgoel	brainwash: yep
2016-07-04 18:56:11	beaky	brainwash whats it like being poor
2016-07-04 18:56:17	IceFireXD	denial of the alcoholism and refusal of help are both choices that are not affected by a disease.
2016-07-04 18:56:26	brainwash	beaky: like.. not having any shoes
2016-07-04 18:56:31	beaky	wow
2016-07-04 18:56:34	Shinra	maybe he trusted these friends and they betrayed him
2016-07-04 18:56:41	Shinra	I've had that happen
2016-07-04 18:56:45	beaky	ye shitty friends
2016-07-04 18:56:50	beaky	"friends"
2016-07-04 18:56:58	IceFireXD	those who deny they're alcoholics..... yeah, they're a lost cause and feeling sympathy for them only makes you look stupid.
2016-07-04 18:57:06	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: sorry, i can't put the living hell of someone else's addiction nightmare into a nifty sentence, so I'm going to pass
2016-07-04 18:57:09	brainwash	friends are the most valuable thing in life
2016-07-04 18:57:13	hgoel	although even then, being careful should work out
2016-07-04 18:57:26	IceFireXD	those who choose to NOT get help for their addiction on the other hand.... they don't deserve sympathy.
2016-07-04 18:57:33	hgoel	had a ton of friends who used to smoke ~12 years old
2016-07-04 18:57:36	Shinra	there isn't a single living being who is not deserving of our compassion
2016-07-04 18:57:51	Shinra	except brainwash I hate him
2016-07-04 18:57:54	IceFireXD	Shinra: there's a difference between compassion, and sympathy.
2016-07-04 18:57:54	beaky	Shinra what about neet hikikomori otaku
2016-07-04 18:58:11	hgoel	and weeaboos?
2016-07-04 18:58:20	brainwash	the whole EU hates you, Shinra
2016-07-04 18:58:28	Shinra	I was setting up the hate brainwash thing
2016-07-04 18:58:31	hgoel	like the ones that fit the actual definition of one
2016-07-04 18:58:35	IceFireXD	being compassionate towards someone who refuses to get help for alcoholism is having an intervention with them and getting them the help they need anyway.
2016-07-04 18:58:41	IceFireXD	that's not sympathetic. it's compassionate.
2016-07-04 18:58:53	brainwash	hate is the strongest emotion
2016-07-04 18:59:09	IceFireXD	imo, hate isn't the strongest emotion, at least not anymore.
2016-07-04 18:59:13	beaky	what about self hatred
2016-07-04 18:59:18	brainwash	what is?
2016-07-04 18:59:20	IceFireXD	loathing, imo, is the strongest emotion
2016-07-04 18:59:25	Shinra	arousal
2016-07-04 18:59:27	brainwash	love?
2016-07-04 18:59:34	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: so who was the addict that you knew that refused treatment?
2016-07-04 19:00:04	brainwash	does the modern human still know what love is?
2016-07-04 19:00:13	IceFireXD	Fenderbassist: are you assuming my opinion/feelings about this are thus because i've had a bad experience with such?
2016-07-04 19:00:13	beaky	did past humans know what love is
2016-07-04 19:00:15	hgoel	love is hormones :|
2016-07-04 19:00:31	brainwash	past humans were apes
2016-07-04 19:00:48	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: well you're repeatedly describing one specific circumstance, which leaves out a wealth of other conditions, so I'm wondering who it was
2016-07-04 19:00:58	beaky	does my cat love 
2016-07-04 19:01:02	IceFireXD	brainwash: you should change your name to some variant of "braindead". it'd suit you so much more.
2016-07-04 19:01:09	Shinra	no beaky, cats love nothing
2016-07-04 19:01:14	brainwash	IceFireXD: why so mean?
2016-07-04 19:01:18	Shinra	your cat is just using you
2016-07-04 19:01:23	IceFireXD	Fenderbassist: i haven't had anyone in my family deal with alcoholism.
2016-07-04 19:01:29	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: friends?
2016-07-04 19:01:32	IceFireXD	i do know how destructive it can be though
2016-07-04 19:01:36	IceFireXD	nope.
2016-07-04 19:01:43	IceFireXD	well
2016-07-04 19:01:45	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: so you have no direct experience?
2016-07-04 19:01:47	IceFireXD	not my friends any how
2016-07-04 19:01:51	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: ok
2016-07-04 19:01:51	IceFireXD	family friends
2016-07-04 19:01:58	Fenderbassist	friends of friends I suppose
2016-07-04 19:02:01	Shinra	it's like brainwash and the elder scrolls
2016-07-04 19:02:03	Shinra	all over again
2016-07-04 19:02:04	IceFireXD	friends of family members
2016-07-04 19:02:08	Fenderbassist	gotcha
2016-07-04 19:02:31	brainwash	you are not allowed to kill yourself
2016-07-04 19:02:40	IceFireXD	tbh, my opinion isn't actually based on my personal experiences though.
2016-07-04 19:02:46	IceFireXD	it's my objective observations.
2016-07-04 19:02:57	Shinra	they are located in one's ass
2016-07-04 19:03:27	hgoel	aren't observations automatically subjective though
2016-07-04 19:03:30	IceFireXD	psychoanalytics is something i do as a hobby, and i've been doing for.... 14 years i think..... so i've gotten pretty damn good at it.
2016-07-04 19:03:40	Shinra	lol
2016-07-04 19:03:46	Shinra	that was an actual lol though
2016-07-04 19:03:49	brainwash	a real expert
2016-07-04 19:04:06	beaky	whats psychoanalytics
2016-07-04 19:04:12	IceFireXD	hgoel: if the observations are literal, first person perspective observations, rather than like.... genre observations
2016-07-04 19:04:18	IceFireXD	that's not the right word
2016-07-04 19:04:20	Shinra	they're located next to the sphincter beaky
2016-07-04 19:04:40	IceFireXD	anyway...
2016-07-04 19:04:43	Fenderbassist	just keep in mind that there are all sorts of other conditions that can aggrevate an addict's situation...abuse, mental illness, hopelessness of the projects...and that's just a few....your subjective observations
2016-07-04 19:05:06	IceFireXD	"of the projects"?
2016-07-04 19:05:23	Fenderbassist	and your hobby, I still have to view it as that of an amateur's
2016-07-04 19:05:30	Fenderbassist	I can appreciate your interest
2016-07-04 19:05:46	Fenderbassist	you are not familair with that term?
2016-07-04 19:05:50	Fenderbassist	familiar*
2016-07-04 19:06:22	IceFireXD	english is my first language, and my lexicon is quite well flushed out.
2016-07-04 19:06:26	Fenderbassist	it refers to low income housing, usually in the worst neighborhoods
2016-07-04 19:06:27	IceFireXD	i'm just not sure what you mean by it.
2016-07-04 19:06:32	IceFireXD	oh
2016-07-04 19:06:34	IceFireXD	housing projects
2016-07-04 19:06:39	Fenderbassist	yes, like ghettos
2016-07-04 19:06:57	beaky	whats it like to live in a ghetto
2016-07-04 19:06:58	IceFireXD	ok, adding "housing" to the phrase, "of the projects" changes it considerably.
2016-07-04 19:07:03	Fenderbassist	beaky: horrible
2016-07-04 19:07:09	Shinra	it's pretty ghetto beaky
2016-07-04 19:07:12	beaky	like brazilian favelas?
2016-07-04 19:07:23	IceFireXD	my spud gun is a project of mine.... 
2016-07-04 19:07:39	Fenderbassist	there's no need to save face
2016-07-04 19:07:40	IceFireXD	so "hopelessness of the projects" could imply that someone else's spud gun isn't coming together as they'd hope

2016-07-04 19:10:28	IceFireXD	i was trying to clarify something.
2016-07-04 19:10:29	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: it's ok
2016-07-04 19:10:52	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: the only thing that matters is, I hope bagelan hangs in there until his refill
2016-07-04 19:11:19	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: and learns a valuable lesson from it
2016-07-04 19:11:26	hgoel	beaky the cat has no reason to meow properly at its property
2016-07-04 19:11:35	Fenderbassist	hgoel: lol
2016-07-04 19:11:40	Fenderbassist	poor beaky :(
2016-07-04 19:11:41	IceFireXD	ya know... that personality trope really irritates me.
2016-07-04 19:12:06	IceFireXD	you assume that i'm trying to correct myself, or make myself look better.... i don't give a flying fuck about that shit.
2016-07-04 19:12:17	IceFireXD	all i wanna know is what you meant by something
2016-07-04 19:12:25	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: ok
2016-07-04 19:13:05	IceFireXD	i just want to clear something up, and instead, those who suffer from this trope, think they need to read between the lines or something like that. no. read the line as it's said. 
2016-07-04 19:13:10	Fenderbassist	beaky: I can't imagine you abusing your cat sir
2016-07-04 19:13:32	Fenderbassist	IceFireXD: it's everyone else's fault
2016-07-04 19:13:40	beaky	is it right to own a cat and play nekopara
2016-07-04 19:13:50	Fenderbassist	beaky: what is nekopara?
2016-07-04 19:13:57	Shinra	as long as you treat your cat the way you treat Chocola it's fine beaky
2016-07-04 19:14:13	IceFireXD	"did you mean this, or that?" < i don't mean, "i'm trying to corner you into saying that, so i'll throw you a loaded/trick question, and then flip it back on you to make you look like shit.". no.... i mean "did you mean this, or that?". nothing more.
2016-07-04 19:14:25	beaky	Fenderbassist: nekopara is a game about having sex with catgirls

2016-07-04 23:16:48	trohrt	vash left instead
2016-07-04 23:17:18	trohrt	i talked to amigojapan and made him understand that that was pretty tyrannical and was not OK and he kind of came to his senses
2016-07-04 23:17:25	beaky	ah
2016-07-04 23:17:36	unicornjedi	trohrt: so why was amigojapan bashing vash on the term weebo
2016-07-04 23:17:52	trohrt	i've asked amigojapan several times to try and reach out to vash and make things right but he completely ignores me when i do
2016-07-04 23:18:13	trohrt	unicornjedi: because amigojapan himself is a literal weeaboo himself and was offended by it
2016-07-04 23:18:25	trohrt	ignore that second himself

2016-07-05 15:34:58	theholyduck	though

2016-07-05 17:02:58	Artemis3	unicornjedi, you are in theory using 14.04 packages while ubuntu studio has 16.04 (2 years), ie. Ardour 2.8 vs Ardour 4.6, or LMMS 1.0 vs 1.3, it might just have solved your issue, but then again don't count on it :3

2016-07-05 18:06:45	Terminus	unicornjedi: if it's source code, there should be instructions telling you how to install it. otherwise, you'll have to read some of the code to figure it out.

2016-07-06 13:55:32	theholyduck	buckling springs use a method of being electrical thats almost impossible to DIY
2016-07-06 13:55:41	theholyduck	well 2 ways
2016-07-06 13:55:49	theholyduck	theres the model F way
2016-07-06 13:55:52	Myrl-saki	theholyduck: there are 3 ways that I can count.
2016-07-06 13:55:53	theholyduck	which uses capacitive sensors
2016-07-06 13:56:00	Myrl-saki	theholyduck: there's also the original way.
2016-07-06 13:56:02	theholyduck	and then theres the model m way
2016-07-06 13:56:07	theholyduck	which is the membrane 
2016-07-06 13:56:08	Myrl-saki	the one they first patented.
2016-07-06 13:56:25	Myrl-saki	using spring<->wall contact.
2016-07-06 13:56:43	theholyduck	Myrl-saki: im pretty sure they never used that
2016-07-06 13:56:44	Myrl-saki	the problem was the debouncing.
2016-07-06 13:56:57	theholyduck	and it wouldnt work with your component anyway.
2016-07-06 13:57:03	theholyduck	because the tilting part is not conductive
2016-07-06 13:57:25	Myrl-saki	theholyduck: I don't think they ever used that because of the debouncing.

2016-07-06 13:58:08	Myrl-saki	or tested it.
2016-07-06 13:58:12	theholyduck	Myrl-saki: this is the original buckling spring pattent
2016-07-06 13:58:15	theholyduck	and it uses capacitve
2016-07-06 13:58:18	theholyduck	as you can see on the drawings
2016-07-06 13:58:30	theholyduck	the foot is capacitive and the changed capacitance is what triggers

2016-07-06 13:59:44	theholyduck	Myrl-saki: the patent describes that.  but thats not really what anyone thinks of as a buckling spring

2016-07-06 13:59:50	theholyduck	Another similar patent is U.S. Pat. No. 3,863,040 in which a compression column spring buckles about its longitudinal axis to contact contactor members at either side. My own previous U.S. Pat. No. 3,699,296 is of the same generic sort and in neither patent is the buckling compression column switch utilized to produce torsional moments on an actuator.
2016-07-06 13:59:51	theholyduck	Instead, the spring itself is the contacting member.

2016-07-06 15:05:43	theholyduck	in aggregate atleast. 7/10 is like "ok"
2016-07-06 15:06:01	theholyduck	almost nothing is ever rated less than 5/10
2016-07-06 15:06:11	theholyduck	and almost nothing is rated 10/10
2016-07-06 15:06:30	theholyduck	6-9/10 is like 99% of anything
2016-07-06 15:06:37	theholyduck	because people dont rate using the full scale
2016-07-06 15:06:50	unicornjedi	10 means easily forgiveable flaws, Great overall enjoyment, and memorable, and rewatchable
2016-07-06 15:07:01	unicornjedi	for me at least
2016-07-06 15:07:18	Shinra	10 is usually perfect

2016-07-06 15:11:09	Jakmodii	Hello
2016-07-06 15:11:12	theholyduck	unicornjedi: :P im trying to prove you wrong but its hard :P
2016-07-06 15:11:15	Smeef	10 is a shot of endorphins and serotonin so powerful it kills me, so I'd be too dead to leave a 10 rating
2016-07-06 15:11:16	theholyduck	im trying to find a mal anime rated at 5
2016-07-06 15:11:23	theholyduck	but all the ones i can find
2016-07-06 15:11:26	theholyduck	i have ltierally never heard of
2016-07-06 15:11:30	Avonis	Jin-Rou comes to my mind
2016-07-06 15:11:43	theholyduck	i wish there was better anime databases
2016-07-06 15:11:44	theholyduck	they all suck
2016-07-06 15:11:49	Sasazuka	Hunter x Hunter manga serial on indefinite hiatus again
2016-07-06 15:11:50	Avonis	serotonin would make you obsessive 
2016-07-06 15:11:52	Sasazuka	:(
2016-07-06 15:12:19	Jakmodii	I'd argue most online reviews suck
2016-07-06 15:12:32	unicornjedi	:D
2016-07-06 15:12:39	Avonis	well it's serotonin deficiency, so I'm wrong
2016-07-06 15:12:56	Avonis	well, so far, I liked anything I've seen beyond the 8/10 mark
2016-07-06 15:13:04	unicornjedi	Avonis: The only reason why I liked jin-rou was it looked like a classic anime
2016-07-06 15:13:18	theholyduck	hmm. lets try anidb. atleast it has some fancy functions
2016-07-06 15:13:20	theholyduck	Jakmodii: well people suck
2016-07-06 15:13:21	unicornjedi	Avonis: the soldiers were cool but I had no idea what was going on
2016-07-06 15:13:21	Avonis	from 6.5 to 8, your mileage may vary
2016-07-06 15:13:29	theholyduck	Jakmodii: im just saying. 
2016-07-06 15:13:36	Jakmodii	I agree
2016-07-06 15:13:44	theholyduck	if you say 5/10
2016-07-06 15:13:45	Avonis	unicornjedi, exactly, politics anime desu yo
2016-07-06 15:13:47	theholyduck	in the way people rate anime
2016-07-06 15:13:52	Avonis	one of Mamouro Oshii masterpieces

2016-07-06 15:14:33	Avonis	oh and the second Patlabor movie, it was just awesome
2016-07-06 15:14:36	unicornjedi	hmmm my tastes have changed but here are my movies that are 10/10 http://www.imdb.com/user/ur30322194/ratings?start=1&view=detail&sort=your_ratings:desc&defaults=1&my_ratings=restrict&defaults=1&my_ratings=restrict

2016-07-06 15:15:00	unicornjedi	dont judge! Im looking at my ratings at I'm like why did i give it a 10/10
2016-07-06 15:15:11	Jakmodii	IMDB either hates me or your link didn't work
2016-07-06 15:15:40	Avonis	it's a private link I believe
2016-07-06 15:15:45	Jakmodii	I think rating something just after you've seen it scews your perception of how much you really enjoyed it
2016-07-06 15:15:55	Jakmodii	Sort of like shopping when you're hungry
2016-07-06 15:16:12	Avonis	not a so good analogy 
2016-07-06 15:16:27	Jakmodii	Its a 1/10 analogy

2016-07-06 16:01:24	Fenderbassist	Smeef: on top of a couple distros
2016-07-06 16:01:45	Smeef	There's always something that is just too big to ignore
2016-07-06 16:01:45	Fenderbassist	Avonis: I always liked the Mint menu

2016-07-06 16:02:49	Avonis	do some googling 
2016-07-06 16:03:01	Smeef	I'd like to see a distro that's comfortable being offline as Windows, something that can be used in the middle of a Congolese jungle with no internet access, but have software installed at the click of a button from removable media.
2016-07-06 16:03:10	paenitentia	might depend on the vm software
2016-07-06 16:03:22	theholyduck	Smeef: linux CAN do that
2016-07-06 16:03:31	theholyduck	but yeah. its generally not SETUP to do that
2016-07-06 16:03:35	theholyduck	and it can be a ballache
2016-07-06 16:03:39	Smeef	theholyduck, I know, but it's not the default seutp
2016-07-06 16:03:46	theholyduck	but like. plenty of third. party applications
2016-07-06 16:03:48	theholyduck	work like t hat

2016-07-06 16:04:37	paenitentia	i want hte ease of use like windows, the options like linux and pretty like a mix of the best of all three (linux,mac,win)
2016-07-06 16:04:44	Smeef	I should also have said "like Windows *used to be*", IDK what the hell Microsoft is trying to pull lately
2016-07-06 16:04:57	kosan	Smeef: I mean, linux software installation is almost always doable offline?
2016-07-06 16:05:25	theholyduck	Smeef: but like. essentially. windows wins out on this because they havent embraced the dictatorship of distros and compiling with shared rather than static
2016-07-06 16:05:27	paenitentia	Smeef, whatever they are doing its not good
2016-07-06 16:05:27	kosan	There's no fancy GUI like Windows, but half the time those fuck my shit up anyways :x
2016-07-06 16:05:38	beaky	smeef isnt that how gentoo and freebsd do it
2016-07-06 16:05:44	theholyduck	Smeef: linux packages COULD be done in such a way where they are mostly self contained and dont need a ton of deps
2016-07-06 16:05:54	Avonis	yep
2016-07-06 16:05:55	Smeef	sometimes doable isn't good enough, technically speaking, me building a rocket to shoot myself to the moon right now is "doable"
2016-07-06 16:05:59	theholyduck	its just the tyrany of the package manager means you cant
2016-07-06 16:06:00	beaky	you always have the entire base and ports tree
2016-07-06 16:06:01	Avonis	Static compiling

If linux is ever gonna move into windows territory, that's a big deal that laypeople will want to have.

2016-07-06 16:44:48	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: I always found it easier to just install a full install as a full install (traditional approach)
2016-07-06 16:45:09	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: if I do frugal installs then yes I just move the save file with all the settings and apps to the new location
2016-07-06 16:45:19	unicornjedi	Fenderbassist, i sheeeee
2016-07-06 16:45:24	Fenderbassist	after I install the basic system

2016-07-06 16:45:47	Fenderbassist	unicornjedi: just install and build

2016-07-06 16:47:17	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: a virtual machine lets you install operating systems into a safe place to try it out or use as an alternate
2016-07-06 16:47:36	Fenderbassist	YetiMaster5000: without wiping your current operating system on a given disc
2016-07-06 16:47:40	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, def not obsd

2016-07-06 20:07:40	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, honestly the way hunter talks in his later years reminds me of an older homeless guy i knew.

2016-07-06 20:09:07	bagelsan	Fenderbassist, i once saw a live band. the singer took 10 shots before he started to perform
2016-07-06 20:09:28	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: hahaha yep, a guy like that gave me and the band tinnitus
2016-07-06 20:09:28	bagelsan	...he couldnt sing at all
2016-07-06 20:09:49	Fenderbassist	bagelsan: "I"m 30, drunk, I think I'll drink 5 more shots, turn my Marshall all the way up and kill the band stage mix

2016-07-07 00:02:47	bagelsan	the amount of filler/binding agents and aceteminophen just for 5-10mg hydrocodone is pathetic
2016-07-07 00:02:51	trohrt	i'm not sure you know what you're talking about if you think that's something people just say. nasal intake of xanax will fuck you up pretty badly man.
2016-07-07 00:03:05	bagelsan	plus hydrocodone is 25% less effective than oxycodone

2016-07-07 14:46:42	bagelsan	like i seen with idol animes
2016-07-07 14:46:59	Urchin[emacs]	it's about how horribly cheap the walking looks, they're just panning the character over a badly predrawn background, and it looks so bad it causes nausea
2016-07-07 14:47:00	brainwash	anime finished ahead of manga

2016-07-07 15:03:05	beaky	why is logh so full of dialogue
2016-07-07 15:03:09	beaky	instead of being like k-on!
2016-07-07 15:03:24	beaky	where everything is explained by hugs and moe
2016-07-07 15:03:28	beaky	(and tea and cakes)
2016-07-07 15:03:38	Urchin[emacs]	because there's a lot of military information to convey
2016-07-07 15:03:59	bagelsan	beaky, watch girls und panzer
2016-07-07 15:04:42	beaky	i like girls und panzer
2016-07-07 15:04:52	beaky	but idk it somehow was more boring than logh why is that
2016-07-07 15:05:05	Urchin[emacs]	lol
2016-07-07 15:05:09	yawnzi	what
2016-07-07 15:05:14	Urchin[emacs]	beaky: your comparisons are fucking weird
2016-07-07 15:05:16	beaky	maybe i need girls und space fleets
2016-07-07 15:05:32	yawnzi	with some scandalous yuri
2016-07-07 15:05:40	beaky	ye logh was a sausage fest
2016-07-07 15:05:59	beaky	but it was good
2016-07-07 15:06:11	beaky	i dont think i can stand to watch 110 episodes of girls und panzer
2016-07-07 15:07:14	beaky	or maybe i can
2016-07-07 15:07:40	bagelsan	i didnt know it was 110
2016-07-07 15:07:51	bagelsan	i thought it was 13 and girls und panzer der film
2016-07-07 15:07:58	bagelsan	and maybe some misc ovas
2016-07-07 15:08:06	Urchin[emacs]	some misc OVAs
2016-07-07 15:08:08	beaky	i hope the remake of logh will be made by kyoani and have moe and cute girls, as is standard for modern 21st century anime 
2016-07-07 15:08:13	Urchin[emacs]	and the last few episodes were recaps

2016-07-09 12:55:26	Fenderbassist	Nanobot: in short, the concept was....if you are in a "Dem" state, don't vote "Rep" but vote "Indie"....a rep vote would do nothing but the indie vote could help build a third party...enough votes and they get federal funding plus invitation to next debate
2016-07-09 12:55:30	beaky	a sufficiently smart compiler should be able to do just about anything i need
2016-07-09 12:55:43	Myrl-saki	pyooooooooooooon: Of course, I extrapolated that data from 10 years ago (IA64), I'd like to see a retry on VLIW. Mill is kinda promising since it has a different take on VLIW.

2016-07-09 13:03:02	pyooooooooooooon	Myrl-saki: You know what? I've come to the realization that truly functional languages don't exist. Functional programming is an idealization, and languages may come arbitrarily close to that idealization. But, at their core, programs still run procedures - it's just that some languages encourage you to write procedures that compute pure functions.

2016-07-09 13:04:13	Myrl-saki	The problem with VLIW, IIRC is that it wanted to be parallel.

2016-07-09 14:46:59	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: I don't think it should be argued. You should use PUT instead.
2016-07-09 14:47:03	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki you know what i mean
2016-07-09 14:47:21	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: I mean it. :s
2016-07-09 14:47:44	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Any reason why you're against the feature request?
2016-07-09 14:47:48	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki what i mean is the feature of finding a duplicate record in POST and returning it as the resource created as a result is what i am against with
2016-07-09 14:47:57	ezekielnoob	i think it should be avalidation error
2016-07-09 14:48:18	Fenderbassist	Shinra: yes, you will have to rest your hands while the calluses firm up
2016-07-09 14:48:26	Shinra	yup I know

2016-07-09 14:48:58	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: POST should be invalidation and PUT should return the resource, IMO.

2016-07-09 14:55:47	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki yep as i thought
2016-07-09 14:57:06	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Also, you can just ell them to use a GET if it returns a 409.
2016-07-09 15:00:44	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Or you can do it functional programming style. Using POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE will return the whole database.
2016-07-09 15:00:52	Myrl-saki	pyon: ^
2016-07-09 15:01:29	ezekielnoob	for a 409 i have to return the Href of the existing record
2016-07-09 15:01:44	ezekielnoob	returning the whole DB doesn't make sense to me

2016-07-09 15:02:14	ezekielnoob	yep
2016-07-09 15:02:21	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Also, with this kind of style, there's no database. The clients share the database with each other!
2016-07-09 15:02:25	ezekielnoob	and REST is more like OOP anyway

2016-07-09 15:04:12	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: A 403 is the next candidate.
2016-07-09 15:04:33	SailorHaumea	back
2016-07-09 15:04:49	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki right now my team just agreed to use 422 for any validation error
2016-07-09 15:05:07	ezekielnoob	so for a POST request, you only can get:
2016-07-09 15:05:08	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Yeah, 422 is another one.
2016-07-09 15:05:42	ezekielnoob	403, 405, 422 (most of the time if the error is in the request body), 500
2016-07-09 15:05:48	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: Also. You shouldn't use POST for things that can be potentially duplicated(e.g. things with ID numbers).
2016-07-09 15:05:56	ezekielnoob	for race condition errors maybe 409 is appropriate
2016-07-09 15:06:16	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: 409 seems to be a less potent 403.
2016-07-09 15:06:24	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki we're not super into the convention :p
2016-07-09 15:06:29	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: :P
2016-07-09 15:06:40	ezekielnoob	i think it's just a pain in the ass to think about what exactly is the proper code to return
2016-07-09 15:06:50	ezekielnoob	when we could've just agree to include in the error message what we want to say
2016-07-09 15:06:52	Myrl-saki	ezekielnoob: I don't think a lot of things are even into the convention that much.
2016-07-09 15:07:01	ezekielnoob	yep
2016-07-09 15:07:25	Myrl-saki	PUT and POST are very easy to mix.
2016-07-09 15:07:56	Myrl-saki	And no one even seems to use PATCH.
2016-07-09 15:08:30	ezekielnoob	Myrl-saki i would absolutely love to try and use patch, but i don't
2016-07-09 15:08:46	ezekielnoob	it's somewhat an oddball

2016-07-10 00:24:55	pyon	amigojapan: Once I tried holding Alt+<right> pressed while WeeChat was still trying to join all channels. And it ended up fucking up really badly: it merged several channel names into a single string, and tried to join a channel whose name was the combined string.
2016-07-10 00:25:19	amigojapan	ah I see pyon 
2016-07-10 00:25:40	amigojapan	I guess it is a bit buggy
2016-07-10 00:26:15	pyon	Concurrent programming is hard, but, come on, why on Earth did WeeChat merge channel names into a single string?
2016-07-10 00:27:07	pyon	For example, it tried to /join something like ##programming#ani, then tried to join me#haskell#sml#oc, then aml#whatever...
2016-07-10 00:27:36	pyon	That simply doesn't make sense. (Unless perhaps you're a C programmer, in which case all sorts of nonsense make sense.)

2016-07-10 00:28:57	beaky	i thought haskell was like rust in that you can just use a concurrency monad or stm magic
2016-07-10 00:29:01	pyon	beaky: Nobody forces you to use STM or MVars. You can use raw IORefs and have the same kind of concurrency bugs that plague C programs.

2016-07-10 00:29:22	pyon	beaky: Talking about Haskell. Rust is actually better than Haskell in this regard.
2016-07-10 00:29:25	beaky	isnt that the programmers fault for not choosing types wisely
2016-07-10 00:29:50	pyon	beaky: Well, in Rust, the only way to do the wrong thing is to deliberately use `unsafe` blocks.

2016-07-10 00:30:03	pyon	amigojapan: Yeah, plain asynchronous I/O handles the task well.
2016-07-10 00:30:10	beaky	ok i guess rust is more bulletproof in that way
2016-07-10 00:31:00	amigojapan	lol. my wife seems really happy now... she is singing the song she is listening to
2016-07-10 00:31:10	pyon	amigojapan: What song is it? :-O
2016-07-10 00:31:11	beaky	where even if i have no idea what im doing i will still write correct concurrency code
2016-07-10 00:31:25	amigojapan	pyon: some jpop, I dont know the name
2016-07-10 00:31:39	beaky	does she like the music in k-on! or love live!
2016-07-10 00:31:45	pyon	beaky: More like “if you have no idea what you're doing, the compiler will reject your code, you'll give up in frustration, and the world will be spared yet another buggy concurrent program”.
2016-07-10 00:31:51	pyon	amigojapan: Ah.
2016-07-10 00:31:57	amigojapan	beaky: she has not watched those
2016-07-10 00:32:37	beaky	love live! is the greatest gift of the anime industry to idol group worshippers
2016-07-10 00:33:35	pyon	Which is better: Love Live! or THE iDOLM@STER?
2016-07-10 00:34:07	pyon	Actually, which one is less likely to make me feel like a creepy pedo or ephebophile?
2016-07-10 00:34:16	beaky	!a the idolm@ster

2016-07-10 00:34:52	pyon	amigojapan: Me either.
2016-07-10 00:35:21	amigojapan	pyon: have you watched AKB48 the real life band?
2016-07-10 00:35:34	bagelsan	they are really popular
2016-07-10 00:35:46	pyon	amigojapan: Nope.
2016-07-10 00:36:14	amigojapan	pyon: ok, well,   their videos have lots of fan service from 14 year olds, so you might not like them
2016-07-10 00:36:43	beaky	havent seen both either
2016-07-10 00:36:46	beaky	but i love k-on!

2016-07-10 00:42:01	Sadale	amigojapan, :( very difficult to fix bugs with avr-libc
2016-07-10 00:42:02	beaky	as a neet hikikomori i am already as banished as can be from life and society
2016-07-10 00:42:12	beaky	avr-libc has bugs?
2016-07-10 00:42:18	Sadale	beaky, It doesn't. My program has.
2016-07-10 00:42:20	beaky	hasnt libc been formally proven correct in coq
2016-07-10 00:42:23	beaky	oh
2016-07-10 00:42:29	Sadale	But IDK what's wrong yet.
2016-07-10 00:42:41	amigojapan	Sadale: do you mean debugging is hard? I made an arduino library simulator for that... I could give you a copy
2016-07-10 00:43:07	Sadale	Somehow the ADC interrupt is keep being activated, despite I didn't ask the MCU to run ADC conversion.
2016-07-10 00:43:20	Sadale	amigojapan, well, debugging with arduino is easy. We've serial interface :P
2016-07-10 00:43:35	Sadale	amigojapan, just use Serial.println(). That helps a lot.
2016-07-10 00:43:40	amigojapan	Sadale: it is not easy when the program crashes
2016-07-10 00:43:46	Sadale	Now I only got a LED for debugging.
2016-07-10 00:43:47	Sadale	amigojapan, oh.
2016-07-10 00:43:57	Sadale	amigojapan, TIL Arduino program crashes.
2016-07-10 00:44:22	amigojapan	Sadale: well, for example cause a segmentation fault, you will never find out
2016-07-10 00:44:30	Sadale	amigojapan, true.
2016-07-10 00:44:47	beaky	do microcontrollers even segfault

2016-07-11 19:58:35	sentionics	I haven't heard of either show you mentioned. All-at-once is always good, imo.
2016-07-11 19:59:45	sentionics	I've gotten to where I don't know much about stuff until it's about done airing. If I start watching a series while it's still airing, I get caught up and the waiting part kills my momentum.

2016-07-11 20:03:53	sentionics	pineappleclock, definitely. I think I'm kind of all in with the binging thing. It's a weird psychological thing I guess. I tend to hit stuff strong starting out, but if I stop, I just can't seem to get up the desire to start again.
2016-07-11 20:04:14	sentionics	I do this with games too.
2016-07-11 20:06:15	sentionics	When you start something, the possibilities are endless. When you resume something, you know pretty well what you're probably getting back into.
2016-07-11 20:06:49	Smeef	I quit TES: Oblivion almost 10 years ago, and it still keeps me up at night that I never completed
2016-07-11 20:07:34	sentionics	I've never played any of the TES series.

2016-08-02 13:42:09	TsundereNoises	I think it's much easier to evaluate a chess position than a go position
2016-08-02 13:42:33	pyon	KaffeeJunky123: Some of the techniques used in computer go basically amount to machine learning - which is primarily used to come up with good solutions when you *don't* understand the problem domain.
2016-08-02 13:43:00	TsundereNoises	I'm terrible at go, sometimes I think I should really get into it
2016-08-02 13:43:10	KaffeeJunky123	Go is a weird game
2016-08-02 13:43:21	pyon	KaffeeJunky123: By this I mean strategies like “what have other players done in similar positions?”, rather than “okay, let's attempt to evaluate the position itself”.
2016-08-02 13:43:21	elios	in chess it just calculates all the moves it can do and evaluates.
2016-08-02 13:43:30	KaffeeJunky123	too complicated to just calc the damn score I get from a move
2016-08-02 13:43:53	KaffeeJunky123	pyon: I'd think new chess computers work that way too
2016-08-02 13:43:58	KaffeeJunky123	not talking gnu chess
2016-08-02 13:44:17	KaffeeJunky123	atleast, learning based AI would be more interesting to play against
2016-08-02 13:44:22	TsundereNoises	KaffeeJunky123: They don't throw out all the work on position evaluation
2016-08-02 13:44:35	TsundereNoises	There is a reason that chess computers are stronger against top human opponents than go computers are
2016-08-02 13:44:38	pyon	KaffeeJunky123: AFAICT, chess software only consults a theory database during the opening and endgames with few enough pieces that the result is actually solved.
2016-08-02 13:44:54	elios	like.. most chess computers would go for your dame even though the pc's would loose theirs.
2016-08-02 13:45:34	elios	and why would you trade the dame in early game, right?
2016-08-02 13:45:53	pyon	elios: Ask those top-level grandmasters who quickly enter Berlin endgames.
2016-08-02 13:46:02	pyon	elios: They trade queens before move 10.
2016-08-02 13:46:16	KaffeeJunky123	u want that pice off the board
2016-08-02 13:46:21	KaffeeJunky123	if you can
2016-08-02 13:46:30	pyon	(In all fairness, those Berlin endgames are almost universally hated by fans. But professionals just play whatever moves give them good results, to hell with fans.)
2016-08-02 13:46:46	TsundereNoises	Also, pros sometimes want to play for the draw

2016-08-02 13:47:37	pyon	TsundereNoises: Giri at the last candidates: +0 =14 -0
2016-08-02 13:47:59	TsundereNoises	And that's a problem that could just be solved with a change to tournament rules...
2016-08-02 13:48:25	pyon	In all fairness, what annoys people isn't draws, but rather grandmaster draws.
2016-08-02 13:48:43	TsundereNoises	I love that stalemate is a thing in chess

2016-08-02 13:48:58	TsundereNoises	I have gotten into so many arguments with people regarding other boardgames that don't want there to be a draw state
2016-08-02 13:49:22	elios	but you don't trade dames in first few moves. if you or your vis-a-vis hasn't a rock solid plan to take you out in the next few. just saying.
2016-08-02 13:49:32	TsundereNoises	but I think it's interesting because it's a reasonable goal to shoot for after the game is already lost or when you're very disadvantaged
2016-08-02 13:49:49	pyon	elios: Exciting queenless positions do exist.
2016-08-02 13:50:00	TsundereNoises	elios: Are you a 1920s gangster?

2016-08-02 16:59:30	CosmicWitch	Lets face it, with anything that involves George Lucas, saying something could have been handled better is the understatement of the year
2016-08-02 17:01:31	CosmicWitch	george lucas is one of the very few people of a creative property where the less he is involved, the happier the fans are

2016-08-02 20:09:53	brainwash	I can take care of a cactus

2016-08-02 20:10:07	IceFireXD	aloe vera can often take care of themselves.
2016-08-02 20:10:39	brainwash	they water themselves?
2016-08-02 20:10:46	IceFireXD	well... no
2016-08-02 20:10:49	TsundereNoises	They don't need a lot of water
2016-08-02 20:10:51	IceFireXD	we kept ours on our patio
2016-08-02 20:10:56	IceFireXD	and that's in arizona
2016-08-02 20:11:03	IceFireXD	and i think we watered it maybe twice a year XD

2016-08-02 20:11:51	IceFireXD	yeah, vermont is probably too wet for them
2016-08-02 20:11:55	TsundereNoises	I also probably shouldn't leave a cactus outside...

2016-08-02 21:12:13	random_numbers	Sure. Point is, though, don't try to build a game engine entirely in python. Anything you can offload to libraries in more efficient/fast languages, do so.
2016-08-02 21:12:44	vlvx	lol no i'm not trying to build a game engine
2016-08-02 21:13:10	vlvx	i have done my own crappy versions though in c++
2016-08-02 21:13:11	random_numbers	One personal pet-peeve of mine with python is that its exception management is a lot less convenient than that of c++ or c#.
2016-08-02 21:13:35	vlvx	oh?
2016-08-02 21:13:36	vlvx	how so?
2016-08-02 21:13:37	kosan	Python game engines are... Mmm. Python is fast, but even as much as I love python, anything beyond 2D games will give you grief.
2016-08-02 21:13:47	kosan	Exception management is fine in Python?
2016-08-02 21:13:55	random_numbers	vlvx: Too much stuff you have to define yourself that should be builtin, imo.
2016-08-02 21:14:15	random_numbers	kosan: Is that stuff I think is missing simply stuff you're meant to get from modules?
2016-08-02 21:14:15	kosan	There's *tons* of builtin exception definitions.
2016-08-02 21:14:24	kosan	Every single one that can be thrown, is importabl.e
2016-08-02 21:14:44	random_numbers	That'd be my mistake then.
2016-08-02 21:14:47	kosan	I mean, it *has* to be, or it couldn't be thrown, unless it was created and discarded after use, which is more work than it's worth.
2016-08-02 21:15:39	vlvx	what's the best way to look into the exception types
2016-08-02 21:15:40	vlvx	for py
2016-08-02 21:15:44	kosan	That said, error handling in a loop can, because try/except is a bit more cpu heavy than just executing the function.
2016-08-02 21:16:15	kosan	Mostly, it depends on the library. For official builtins, the python doc pages are your friend.
2016-08-02 21:16:26	vlvx	ok.
2016-08-02 21:16:30	kosan	There might be a way to find them in the repl, but I just keep a doc page open.
2016-08-02 21:16:51	random_numbers	Or download a local mirror. I can't remember if the site offers one prepacked...
2016-08-02 21:17:35	kosan	I think pythons doc pages are built using a builtin from Python...
2016-08-02 21:17:57	vlvx	do you guys write py code from command line?
2016-08-02 21:17:59	vlvx	or with an ide?
2016-08-02 21:17:59	kosan	It should be possible to generate the full doc pages from a normal install, if I'm not mistaken?
2016-08-02 21:18:06	kosan	I use vim, personally.
2016-08-02 21:18:23	kosan	If you need a full IDE, I recommend pycharm, it works well, but lacked the flexibility my vim install gives me.
2016-08-02 21:18:35	vlvx	i'm used to jetbrains ides
2016-08-02 21:18:49	vlvx	pretty sure you can use it like a vim interface
2016-08-02 21:18:51	vlvx	with some plugin
2016-08-02 21:18:51	vlvx	:P
2016-08-02 21:18:59	kosan	There is one, but frankly I found it to be lackluster.
2016-08-02 21:19:21	kosan	Mostly because a lot of the features from PyCharm aren't bound to the vim interface, so you still end up using the mouse a lot.
2016-08-02 21:19:24	random_numbers	I tend to use vim. There's one 'libre' one dedicated to python, but I've never tried it.
2016-08-02 21:19:29	kosan	My dev environment can be run 100% from keyboard.
2016-08-02 21:19:51	kosan	Except Chrome, but if I wanted to get picky, I could just use Lynx :p

2016-08-02 21:33:04	kosan	It might be due to the Linux software not supporting encrypted streaming; That's why Netflix still uses Silverlight.
2016-08-02 21:33:06	mathu	chrome has pepper flash/ppapi flash, but that is a reimplementation without the proprietary HAL DRM mechanism thing

2016-08-02 21:34:26	vlvx	you can use @classmethod to make any method of the class static?
2016-08-02 21:34:27	kosan	Ah, I remember they were talking about finally migrating away from silverlight. Didn't know if they had.
2016-08-02 21:34:34	random_numbers	You could try 'livestreamer' or 'youtube-dl' with 'mpv' as a player.
2016-08-02 21:34:41	vlvx	and is that good practice?
2016-08-02 21:34:52	mathu	funny thing is though the fact that they bar me from consuming content even if i pay for it removes any ethical obstacle to piracy :P
2016-08-02 21:34:57	kosan	Static methods in classes are okay when they are needed; The question is if you need them.
2016-08-02 21:35:28	mathu	vlvx: isn't it @staticmethod
2016-08-02 21:35:59	kosan	They tend to work really well for functions with no side effects, only a return value, and aid greatly in mixing those with threaded/async stuff.

2016-08-02 21:36:20	kosan	@classmethod iirc is a bit different, yeah. It's close, but not exactly the same. I can't remember the actual difference >.>
2016-08-02 21:36:27	kosan	Never found a use case for @classmethod myself.
2016-08-02 21:36:28	vlvx	yeah that's confusing
2016-08-02 21:38:08	vlvx	actually
2016-08-02 21:38:12	mathu	i like python, it's my goto for most personal things
2016-08-02 21:38:28	mathu	i'd like for it to be haskell, but i get too rusty with haskell i think
2016-08-02 21:38:45	vlvx	i see, so when you use @staticmethod you don't define the method with def function(self)
2016-08-02 21:38:53	vlvx	whereas with @classmethod you can just call it
2016-08-02 21:38:57	vlvx	without instantiating it
2016-08-02 21:39:06	vlvx	and it has function(self)

2016-08-02 21:51:08	kosan	I was thinking of something like trying to pickle the function signature and ship it off with the args on submission. Dunno how well that'd work though.
2016-08-02 21:52:22	kosan	DHT would be kinda neat, seems it'd lend itself to more of a mesh than a hub; Which would be awesome in it's own right.
2016-08-02 21:52:52	kosan	Being able to hit *any* of the meshed servers with a request, and have it load balance it across to another system.
2016-08-02 21:53:33	random_numbers	Ah yeah. I kinda forgot the 'hub' part of the sentence.
2016-08-02 21:54:50	kosan	I figured hub might be easier to auto-configure so long as the center was pre-defined. But mesh would be neat to, and discoveries could easily be shared across the whole network.
2016-08-02 21:55:55	random_numbers	Hub would definitely be easier.

2016-08-30 18:06:48	Shinra	sacrificing a slot for a HM is no biggy
2016-08-30 18:07:00	brainwash	that's nice

2016-08-30 18:07:17	Shinra	cuz the movepool is enormous and pokemon can learn so many different ones
2016-08-30 18:07:30	brainwash	can I fly on a pidgey? or do I have to evolve it first?

2016-08-30 18:41:43	kosan	I've been thinking about looking into another filesystem as a primary storage type. Usually my Linux setups just run ext4, and I haven't done enough looking into other filesystems to see if it'd be worth going for something else.
2016-08-30 18:42:15	warsh	ZFS is king
2016-08-30 18:42:27	warsh	its amazing, but there might be beugs on linux
2016-08-30 18:42:35	warsh	btrfs is another option
2016-08-30 18:42:37	kosan	Was planning on using ZFS for a NAS, wasn't sure if it was a good idea for a normal use partition.
2016-08-30 18:42:45	kosan	I was looking into btrfs for that reason :P
2016-08-30 18:43:30	kosan	I don't have a machine with enough drive space to dedicate to FreeNAS atm, so I'm kinda stuck with 'what works for everyday use', and hopefully not *too* much maintenance.
2016-08-30 18:43:58	warsh	kosan: build up to it
2016-08-30 18:44:09	warsh	as in, start buying 3 or 4TB drives whenever their on sale
2016-08-30 18:44:17	kosan	warsh: That's the idea, but atm I'm broke. ;-;
2016-08-30 18:44:17	warsh	when you use ZFS, you can't add more drives later
2016-08-30 18:44:24	warsh	keep that in mind
2016-08-30 18:44:37	kosan	And the next drive I buy, needs to expand my current drives in my main rig.
2016-08-30 18:44:51	kosan	I thought you could? It's a touch involved, but you should be able to?
2016-08-30 18:45:03	warsh	its not a balanced system then
2016-08-30 18:45:15	warsh	if you want redundancy
2016-08-30 18:45:29	kosan	I was pretty sure that at least FreeNAS(and the like) had tools to rebalance the filesystem...
2016-08-30 18:46:05	kosan	Resilver was it? Or was that for something else? @_@ I haven't read up on it in a while, because I knew I wouldn't have the money to set up a machine for a while.

2016-08-30 18:47:33	kosan	Ah. Seems it isn't doable out of the box, but it seems there are a lot of solutions available. *shrug*
2016-08-30 18:47:37	TsundereNoises	well I'll try ext4 again then

2016-08-30 19:10:02	kosan	I really should look into switching my storage back to ext4 and running linux, then making a VM with disk access and running a samba share or something... But I don't have enough storage to float through the transition... http://i.imgur.com/EhjDtsJ.png

2016-08-30 19:10:18	theholyduck	so i just set up all like 8 discs in my  raid under the virtual machine
2016-08-30 19:10:32	theholyduck	and then bought 1 large HDD to help manage the transition
2016-08-30 19:10:46	theholyduck	as i recall my linux system broke completely and i just gave up and installed windows and dealt with the files later.
2016-08-30 19:11:01	theholyduck	+ linux ntfs support was a bit shaky in like 2009-10
2016-08-30 19:11:59	kosan	Yeah, I have a utility that will let me pull files from ext partitions, unfortunately it doesn't mount it proper, so it's a 'copy these files over now', instead of 'access this media' deal. :<

2016-08-30 19:12:13	theholyduck	kosan: well. EXT stil sorta worked
2016-08-30 19:12:16	theholyduck	atleast ext2/3
2016-08-30 19:12:26	theholyduck	but linux software raid. zfs and xfs were all not supported
2016-08-30 19:12:29	theholyduck	all 3 at the same time. 
2016-08-30 19:12:30	theholyduck	lol
2016-08-30 19:12:38	kosan	When I built this machine, I decided to run just Linux. That lasted... 6 months? I even showed up to a LAN with just Arch on it :P
2016-08-30 19:12:42	theholyduck	er not zfs
2016-08-30 19:12:43	theholyduck	i ment LVM
2016-08-30 19:12:48	theholyduck	been so long since i derped with this
2016-08-30 19:12:50	kosan	Played every game at the party without much problem.

2016-08-30 21:52:37	sscout	they had 1 out of 30+ readings positive, Arecibo will have to look because some idiot told the press
2016-08-30 21:52:51	Smeef	sscout, or a genuine negative, as Kierkegaard would say...
2016-08-30 21:52:56	sscout	but it's extremely unlikely that it's anything
2016-08-30 21:53:22	sscout	I should read Kierkegaard but... stares at the 100 open e-books on his phone

2016-08-30 22:24:01	Big_G	Fenderbassist, Is that something you have on loop? It fits the show well but not really listening music (save for the jazz songs)
2016-08-30 22:24:30	Fenderbassist	Big_G: I disagree, I have listened to Bebop music for years
2016-08-30 22:24:41	Fenderbassist	Big_G: they released so many CDs back when CDs were a thing
2016-08-30 22:25:07	Fenderbassist	Big_G: you might prefer something different though, based on that statement :)
2016-08-30 22:25:12	Big_G	Fenderbassist, Do you have any links? Maybe it's been too long since I've listened to them. The song that pops into my head is the weird space one on Ed's planet

2016-08-30 23:43:49	pteague	TsundereNoises, partly joking ... i did enjoy it ... just wanted it to last longer
2016-08-30 23:43:59	TsundereNoises	There are plenty of things I like that went on too long and I can enjoy the first bits, but most of my all time favorite things have a planned ending
2016-08-30 23:44:03	pteague	or maybe i was having so much fun time went too fast
2016-08-30 23:44:05	TsundereNoises	but then I prefer short stories to novels
2016-08-30 23:44:29	TsundereNoises	pteague: You might be partially joking, but a lot of people really do decide they don't like something because it didn't overstay it's welcome
2016-08-30 23:44:40	TsundereNoises	a good ending just has so much punch for me though
2016-08-30 23:44:58	Nanobot	His palms are hairy, eyes wide, arms are very exhausted, his posture's just barely an inch from where he would tumble, but all the rumble of his jerking chair is what's working on all those lurking wear and tear haps.

2016-08-30 23:50:54	Smeef	Better question, what's the criteria for a perfect ending?
2016-08-30 23:50:57	TsundereNoises	tv and anime tend to screw up endings a lot

2016-08-30 23:53:45	TsundereNoises	sometimes they can be great, but having a complicated bunch of things happening is interesting
2016-08-30 23:54:02	TsundereNoises	resolving the main question/conflict is important I think
2016-08-30 23:54:07	TsundereNoises	even if it's just a failure to change
2016-08-30 23:55:01	Smeef	Then we have completely open endings like Inception where the audience is just left dangling
2016-08-30 23:56:20	Smeef	Or endings like NGE where the plot is sorta tied up, but now there's a whole new world and plot I wanna see play out, lol
2016-08-30 23:56:44	pteague	i liked inception, but also hated it ... because of the open ending ...

2016-08-30 23:58:10	TsundereNoises	for an open ending that I loved though, has anyone seen Let The Right One In?

2016-08-30 23:58:35	TsundereNoises	that's one where I think the ambiguity of the ending makes it
2016-08-30 23:58:39	Smeef	TsundereNoises, I haven't seen the original or the remake, but I hear they're good
2016-08-30 23:59:34	TsundereNoises	I've only watched the original because the remake seemed so pointless
2016-08-30 23:59:42	TsundereNoises	although I hear it's almost shot-for-shot
2016-08-30 23:59:47	Smeef	Horror stories are sort of an exception, having an open ending, or one where the protagonist isn't victorious is kinda the point
2016-08-31 00:00:04	+ImoutoBot	New episode for: MAR | Episode: 7
2016-08-31 00:00:19	TsundereNoises	Smeef: I'm not sure that really fits what the ending is in this case
2016-08-31 00:00:31	TsundereNoises	I mean, protagonist isn't really victorious is technically true I guess
2016-08-31 00:00:46	Smeef	No spoilers, I haven't seen it, lol
2016-08-31 00:01:01	TsundereNoises	but it has very little in common with the standard horror movie "monster defeated, go back to normal life, but maybe the monster is still alive??!?" ending
2016-08-31 00:01:05	Smeef	Was just making a general observation
2016-08-31 00:01:07	TsundereNoises	nah, I won't say more than that
2016-08-31 00:01:38	TsundereNoises	The ending is what makes it a great movie though
2016-08-31 00:02:05	pteague	meh, only good horror movies i think i've seen have bruce campbell in them :p
2016-08-31 00:02:25	Smeef	Horror-comedies, lol

2016-08-31 00:02:46	TsundereNoises	I mean, Army of Darkness is an example of a great ending!
2016-08-31 00:02:51	TsundereNoises	but you should probably watch more horror movies
2016-08-31 00:02:58	Smeef	Does Bubba Ho-Tep count as a horror? lol

2016-08-31 00:20:10	TsundereNoises	but yeah, I guess I'd say start with the recent show?  The characters are the same in all of them, but you don't need a particular introduction or anything
2016-08-31 00:20:32	TsundereNoises	Yeah, I don't think the writers are ever under the delusion that they're being gritty and realistic

2016-09-01 20:45:47	IceFireXD	bears are opportunists and will happily eat you if you don't put up a fight.
2016-09-01 20:46:28	Avonis	captain obvious 
2016-09-01 20:46:30	IceFireXD	instead, try and scare the bear, throw your hands in the air, yell, roar, make yourself seem like a tough fight. the bear will likely decide you aren't worth the effort.
2016-09-01 20:46:43	IceFireXD	the exception to this, is a momma bear with her cubs.
2016-09-01 20:46:56	IceFireXD	if you come across that... you're fucked. start praying and try backing away slowly.

2016-09-01 20:51:29	sx0	LOL
2016-09-01 20:51:30	IceFireXD	the bear will recognize the bowing of the head as a sign of submission.

2016-09-01 20:52:10	sx0	got taught in elementary school that if you run into an angry elk/moose you just wave your arms around and scream and it will pussy out
2016-09-01 20:52:14	IceFireXD	if she's already charging.... honestly, your best bet is to just hold your ground and do like i said earlier.
2016-09-01 20:52:22	sx0	but i guess if you do that to a bear they will accept the challenge
2016-09-01 20:52:25	IceFireXD	just do NOT charge the bear.
2016-09-01 20:52:44	IceFireXD	also, don't back down while making yourself look like a challenge.
2016-09-01 20:52:57	IceFireXD	if the bear stops their charge, then you can start backing up.
2016-09-01 20:53:32	IceFireXD	you just need to understand what is viewed as prey behavior, and what is viewed as aggression.
2016-09-01 20:53:36	IceFireXD	running is prey behavior.

2016-09-01 21:29:31	Nanobot	Any microwave recommendations?
2016-09-01 21:29:38	IceFireXD	panasonic.
2016-09-01 21:29:45	epitaph	Fire
2016-09-01 21:29:52	IceFireXD	ours is a 1250w unit
2016-09-01 21:30:13	Nanobot	Every Panasonic model I see costs like twice what everything else costs
2016-09-01 21:30:48	Nanobot	I usually deliberately reduce the power level, to cook more evenly
2016-09-01 21:31:33	IceFireXD	heh, you'll have to do that with a 1250w unit too...
2016-09-01 21:31:41	IceFireXD	since most things are rated for a 1100w unit
2016-09-01 21:32:09	Nanobot	Maybe I should get a 600w unit
2016-09-01 21:32:14	IceFireXD	unless it's ramen. those are rated for 1000w units.
2016-09-01 21:32:19	paenitentia	get a 9001
2016-09-01 21:32:21	IceFireXD	i'd advise against that.
2016-09-01 21:32:44	Nanobot	I never pay attention to cooking times on instructions. I just learn by trial and error.
2016-09-01 21:32:46	IceFireXD	my mom had a 600w unit... and it was a bitch to get it to do anything
2016-09-01 21:32:55	IceFireXD	even popping popcorn was a pain
2016-09-01 21:33:03	IceFireXD	why not?
2016-09-01 21:33:17	IceFireXD	the instructions give you a good ballpark for the time, rather than guessing
2016-09-01 21:33:23	IceFireXD	guessing wastes the food.
2016-09-01 21:34:07	Nanobot	When I cook popcorn in my current microwave, I do it at power level 7. The problem is it achieves power level 7 by being on for a few seconds and off for a few seconds, so it's kinda uneven
2016-09-01 21:34:43	Nanobot	IceFireXD: Wha? I get to know my microwave pretty quickly, and it's trivial to adjust times accordingly
2016-09-01 21:35:10	Nanobot	My whole life, I've had overpowered microwaves, and I've just learned that this is a 25-second kind of food and this is a 55-second kind of food.

2016-09-01 22:33:12	pyon	Nanobot: Hataraku Maou-sama, dat episode 12.
2016-09-01 22:33:20	IceFireXD	kosan: nice.
2016-09-01 22:33:22	Nanobot	I don't remember what episode 12 was
2016-09-01 22:33:36	pyon	Nanobot: Fighting in undewear. And “you damn washboard!”
2016-09-01 22:33:37	Nanobot	I just remember it didn't get a second season it deserved

2016-09-01 22:34:05	kosan	IceFireXD: I don't have you on Steam D:
2016-09-01 22:34:14	kosan	But that is amazing nonetheless
2016-09-01 22:34:19	Nanobot	Premise of Hataraku Maou-sama: Video game characters get trapped in the real world.
2016-09-01 22:34:31	IceFireXD	kosan: i use the same name everywhere. it's either IceFireXD, or The_IceFireXD
2016-09-01 22:34:44	Nanobot	Specifically, the boss of the game and the hero both get trapped here, and they have to, like, find a way to pay rent
2016-09-01 22:34:47	pyon	Nanobot: Pretty much!
2016-09-01 22:34:58	TsundereNoises	Cute, Funny, and Good seems like a really big list of possibilities
2016-09-01 22:34:58	pyon	Nanobot: And it's way better than the other way around.
2016-09-01 22:35:19	kosan	Eh, if done right the reverse is entertaining too.
2016-09-01 22:35:20	IceFireXD	Nanobot: kinda sounds like Overlord.
2016-09-01 22:35:31	kosan	I mean, Log Horizon is easily one of my favorite shows. So there's that.
2016-09-01 22:35:36	kosan	Then again, maybe I just have shit tastes.
2016-09-01 22:35:43	IceFireXD	oh, hey... overlord is another anime where the MC is a total badass.
2016-09-01 22:35:53	kosan	I still haven't seen Overlord.
2016-09-01 22:35:56	pyon	kosan: I'm reluctanct to try the genre after SAO. :-|
2016-09-01 22:36:03	pyon	try the genre again*
2016-09-01 22:36:05	kosan	The person who suggested it to me was like "It's just like Log Horizon!"
2016-09-01 22:36:20	kosan	Oh, definately check out Log Horizon. It will save the theme for you.
2016-09-01 22:36:20	+Moyst	It's 'definitely'.
2016-09-01 22:36:28	kosan	... Can I shoot Moyst yet?

2016-09-01 22:36:43	kosan	So many things need another season ;-;
2016-09-01 22:36:46	IceFireXD	until it gets the 3rd season, it feels like spice and wolf.
2016-09-01 22:36:49	pyon	kosan: Already finished, or still airing?
2016-09-01 22:36:51	IceFireXD	and unfinished anime
2016-09-01 22:36:55	IceFireXD	an*

2016-09-01 22:37:02	pyon	IceFireXD: Ah.
2016-09-01 22:37:05	IceFireXD	kosan: spice and wolf needs an s3.
2016-09-01 22:37:06	kosan	Even unfinished, it's still a fantastic show.
2016-09-01 22:37:06	TsundereNoises	Spice and Wolf will never get the third season it needs and that is sad
2016-09-01 22:37:08	IceFireXD	it's a great anime.
2016-09-01 22:37:12	IceFireXD	but it needs to be finished.
2016-09-01 22:37:26	kosan	It may not get the 3rd season it needs, but you could always just read the LN's *shrug*
2016-09-01 22:37:28	IceFireXD	kosan: look at my rating on S&W.... pretty sure it's either 4.5 or 5.
2016-09-01 22:37:31	kosan	That's what I'm doing.
2016-09-01 22:37:31	IceFireXD	of 5
2016-09-01 22:37:46	IceFireXD	... i'm not one for reading
2016-09-01 22:37:54	IceFireXD	well, not LN or manga anyhow
2016-09-01 22:37:56	kosan	I am bad about spending time reading myself.
2016-09-01 22:38:12	kosan	I keep copies of LN's and manga on my phone for when I'm waiting for things away from my PC :P
2016-09-01 22:38:21	IceFireXD	i want to relax when i'm enjoying my japanese created stories....
2016-09-01 22:38:24	IceFireXD	reading is too much effort
2016-09-01 22:38:30	IceFireXD	well, not including subs
2016-09-01 22:38:31	kosan	Reading? Effort? >.>
2016-09-01 22:38:46	IceFireXD	no, progressing through the pages
2016-09-01 22:38:55	kosan	I used to get in trouble in school for reading too much... Mostly because I'd not realize the teacher wanted our attention and just keep reading...
2016-09-01 22:39:11	kosan	Or the time when a teacher told me to stop reading while walking through the halls...
2016-09-01 22:39:11	DaPinkOne	kosan, if you know the answers, fuck em.
2016-09-01 22:39:43	IceFireXD	i actually got yelled at for not reviewing before a test
2016-09-01 22:39:44	DaPinkOne	i read in the halls and slept through class, so maybe i'm not the best here though
2016-09-01 22:40:00	IceFireXD	i wouldn't review, yet i'd score either B's or A's...
2016-09-01 22:40:04	kosan	DaPinkOne: That's what I did in Psychology. I napped through the class, and on the open book/note tests, I just answered them straight off the top of my head, finished first, and still got 90%+ on the tests :x
2016-09-01 22:40:07	IceFireXD	showing i ACTUALLY learned the info
2016-09-01 22:40:16	IceFireXD	but yet they'd still complain
2016-09-01 22:40:21	kosan	I got in trouble for not making note cards for presentations in HS...
2016-09-01 22:40:29	DaPinkOne	kosan, classes are easy if you're actually interested in the material.
2016-09-01 22:40:30	pyon	kosan: You should've told them “if you want me to pay attention, make your class actually interesting”.
2016-09-01 22:40:34	kosan	Like, the note cards were worth as amuch as the presentations...
2016-09-01 22:40:40	pyon	kosan: “It's not my fault that your class is boring as fuck.”
2016-09-01 22:40:42	IceFireXD	kosan: i got yelled at in english and history for not taking effective notes.
2016-09-01 22:40:53	IceFireXD	even though i still got B's and A's on tests
2016-09-01 22:40:56	kosan	IceFireXD: TBF, I kinda wish I had learned to take better notes in HS...
2016-09-01 22:41:04	kosan	I'm awful at taking notes now, and it sucks :<
2016-09-01 22:41:08	DaPinkOne	pyon, that's not always the teacher's fault, and being a dick to them's not really going to make them want to fix it
2016-09-01 22:41:10	IceFireXD	my overall grades were always F's though
2016-09-01 22:41:17	Fenderbassist	gn all, be well

2016-09-01 22:41:26	IceFireXD	why? cause the teachers were dumb as fuck and made homework count for 60% of the grade
2016-09-01 22:41:31	IceFireXD	and i never did homework
2016-09-01 22:41:32	kosan	Yup.
2016-09-01 22:41:34	IceFireXD	not once
2016-09-01 22:41:47	IceFireXD	homework was ALWAYS review. 
2016-09-01 22:41:49	kosan	My teachers almost all told me at one time or another that if they could pass me on test scores alone, they would.
2016-09-01 22:41:55	IceFireXD	why should review be 60% of my grade?
2016-09-01 22:42:00	IceFireXD	tests only counted for 10%
2016-09-01 22:42:07	IceFireXD	tests/quizzes
2016-09-01 22:42:12	pyon	DaPinkOne: It's absolutely the teacher's fault. While classes aren't supposed to be fun, they aren't supposed to be sleep-inducing either.
2016-09-01 22:42:15	kosan	Actually, somehow I think my psych teacher did make that happen...
2016-09-01 22:42:35	IceFireXD	kosan: the teacher determines how much test/quiz scores matter.
2016-09-01 22:42:39	pyon	DaPinkOne: A class that doesn't keep you intellectually engaged is basically a waste of time.
2016-09-01 22:42:42	IceFireXD	that's not something the school normally chooses.
2016-09-01 22:42:52	DaPinkOne	pyon, it's not that they "aren't supposed to be fun", but that they have such a large amount of specific material that they have to cover in order to follow the curiculum, and they're pressed for time.

2016-09-01 22:43:05	kosan	IceFireXD: Yes, but once they've made a decision, it's usually not good to show favoritism to individual students.
2016-09-01 22:43:24	DaPinkOne	they also have to submit their class plans to supervision for approval, so any "fun" ideas may be shut down if they're trying to rock the boat of convention
2016-09-01 22:43:26	IceFireXD	kosan: that's when the teacher gives the student the option to test through the class.
2016-09-01 22:43:49	IceFireXD	if you already know all that they plan to teach you... there's no point in having you in the class, and they should just give you the credit.
2016-09-01 22:44:03	IceFireXD	since the credits are intended to give a rough idea of how much you have learned/know.
2016-09-01 22:44:22	kosan	Eh, I still learned from some of the classes. And psych was an elective. I just used it to catch up on sleep.
2016-09-01 22:44:34	IceFireXD	heh...
2016-09-01 22:44:43	IceFireXD	i had psychology as one of my electives
2016-09-01 22:44:51	pyon	DaPinkOne: Somehow I could read all my textbooks in the month between when my parents bought them (February) and when classes actually started (March).
2016-09-01 22:44:52	kosan	I technically took Algebra 2 as an elective.
2016-09-01 22:44:58	IceFireXD	but the class was actually cancelled about 2 weeks into the class
2016-09-01 22:45:05	IceFireXD	cause there were only 3 people who took it xD
2016-09-01 22:45:15	DaPinkOne	pyon, your reading speed and retention are above normal then.
2016-09-01 22:45:21	kosan	I'm just sad I didn't take physics before transfering. Physics in the school I transfered to sucked.
2016-09-01 22:45:28	DaPinkOne	personally, I don't think that would have been possible.
2016-09-01 22:45:45	IceFireXD	i wanted to take japanese
2016-09-01 22:45:47	pyon	DaPinkOne: Nah. When I read actually deep books, it takes me a lot of time and effort, just like everyone else.
2016-09-01 22:45:54	IceFireXD	but my school only had spanish, german, french, and swedish.
2016-09-01 22:46:00	kosan	No real math, principles, etc beyond "Hypothesis, lab, writeup". Yeah, I can get that from my Chemistry courses, kthx.
2016-09-01 22:46:10	pyon	DaPinkOne: Right now, I read books where I'm very happy if I can understand ten pages in a day.
2016-09-01 22:46:12	kosan	German, French, and Spanish were my options.
2016-09-01 22:46:19	IceFireXD	i took spansih
2016-09-01 22:46:28	IceFireXD	spanish*
2016-09-01 22:46:28	DaPinkOne	pyon, well, not everybody is so self-driven, and they need somebody to hold their hand through it, I guess
2016-09-01 22:46:30	IceFireXD	and it was shit.
2016-09-01 22:46:32	kosan	Ofc, back then I wasn't really interested in Japanese anyways, so even were it an option, I may not have take it.
2016-09-01 22:46:36	kosan	I took German :D
2016-09-01 22:46:38	IceFireXD	i took spanish back in arizona.... much better class.
2016-09-01 22:46:54	IceFireXD	the teacher actually spoke spanish fluently, and frequently visited spain.

2016-09-01 22:47:29	kosan	I used to be able to hold a light conversation in German. Now the best I can do is point out where the cheese is.
2016-09-01 22:47:33	IceFireXD	DaPinkOne: in arizona, the teacher was a US native.
2016-09-01 22:48:19	DaPinkOne	that's impressive
2016-09-01 22:48:20	pyon	Spanish isn't a language worth learning. Where are the scientific publications in Spanish? The graduate math/science/whatever textbooks in Spanish?
2016-09-01 22:48:21	IceFireXD	he also had a rule, that if you wanted to know how to say a given word in spanish, you needed to ask in spanish.
2016-09-01 22:48:25	kosan	Ah, the rules of speaking during langauge class. Year 1 was kinda lax. Year 2? If you were going to say something, it was in German. The teacher also spoke almost purely in German, except to give examples of similar things in English. Good class.
2016-09-01 22:48:35	IceFireXD	and because of that, i know, "como se dice ____ in espanol?"
2016-09-01 22:48:46	IceFireXD	en?
2016-09-01 22:48:49	IceFireXD	in?

2016-09-01 22:48:52	pyon	As a native Spanish speaker, I can tell you guys, I wouldn't bother learning the language if I weren't a native speaker.
2016-09-01 22:48:56	IceFireXD	yeah, that didn't look right 
2016-09-01 22:48:58	IceFireXD	:P
2016-09-01 22:49:02	DaPinkOne	pyon, there are publications in spanish, and in other languages. I had to read a research paper in portuguese for one of my classes last semester.
2016-09-01 22:49:04	kosan	Was ist ____ auf Deutsch? :P
2016-09-01 22:49:35	IceFireXD	pyon: how do you spell the word for shut up? galliete?
2016-09-01 22:49:41	pyon	IceFireXD: Cállate.
2016-09-01 22:49:42	kosan	Damn, it's been what... 6, no.. 7 years since German class? Jeeeez
2016-09-01 22:49:45	IceFireXD	thank you
2016-09-01 22:49:47	DaPinkOne	the body of work is substantially larger in english, as the lingua franca, but I wouldn't completely discount other languages.
2016-09-01 22:49:55	pyon	IceFireXD: I mean, I'm not telling *you* to shut up, that's just the spelling.
2016-09-01 22:49:59	IceFireXD	i know
2016-09-01 22:50:00	pyon	DaPinkOne: Somehow I never stumble upon those. I find scientific publications in German and French every now and then.
2016-09-01 22:50:05	IceFireXD	that's why i thanked you :P
2016-09-01 22:50:09	pyon	:-p
2016-09-01 22:50:19	DaPinkOne	pyon, I found them through my college's journal search engine
2016-09-01 22:50:26	kosan	I consume way too much Japanese media to not know Japanese tbh :x
2016-09-01 22:50:40	DaPinkOne	it was published in a portuguese journal which happened to be related to my topic of research
2016-09-01 22:50:45	pyon	kosan: Dunno, I consume lots of Japanese media, and I don't understand anything beyond isolated words.
2016-09-01 22:50:51	IceFireXD	also, because of spanish, i actually gained a better understanding of english :P
2016-09-01 22:50:58	kosan	Almost nothing is ever in German and untranslated, so knowing it has hardly helped me except one time as an admin
2016-09-01 22:51:16	IceFireXD	i understand a fair amount of spoken japanese.... kanji and kana? not a chance.
2016-09-01 22:51:23	kosan	pyon: No, not like I should be learning it from watching shows, just that it's kinda frustrating having to wait for translations, some things of which never get translated >.<
2016-09-01 22:51:25	DaPinkOne	kosan, i consume a lot of english media. I still don't understand the brits half the time. language is hard.
2016-09-01 22:51:54	kosan	British people are fuckered. Had a bit too much tea to drink, methinks.
2016-09-01 22:51:59	IceFireXD	DaPinkOne: that's cause the brits speak english with archaic spelling, pronunciation, and words.
2016-09-01 22:52:09	kosan	(I actually almost prefer their spellings for a lot of thigns, personally...)
2016-09-01 22:52:50	DaPinkOne	british spelling makes sense for some things, like colour, behaviour, etc, but their slang and some of their accents are indecipherable for me.
2016-09-01 22:52:55	pyon	kosan: Once, a show was taking ages to be subbed, so instead I tried watching the raws, and use Google Translate to translate whatever little I could understand phonetically. It took me 30 minutes to correctly translate a single (admittedly, rather long) sentence.
2016-09-01 22:53:04	pyon	and using*
2016-09-01 22:53:13	IceFireXD	DaPinkOne: .... how the fuck does it make sense for color?
2016-09-01 22:53:37	IceFireXD	"cuh-luhr", vs "cuh-loor"
2016-09-01 22:53:40	DaPinkOne	pyon, why didn't you find the subtitle file in japanese, and google translate that?
2016-09-01 22:54:10	pyon	DaPinkOne: There was none.
2016-09-01 22:54:12	DaPinkOne	IceFireXD, it depends which part of the US you're in, but I find the -our pronunciation more common.
2016-09-01 22:54:32	IceFireXD	pyon: if it's a slice of life highschool anime, i can probably watch raws of it without much difficulty.
2016-09-01 22:54:49	pyon	IceFireXD: Those only use cliché phrases anyway.
2016-09-01 22:54:51	IceFireXD	DaPinkOne: .... well, those pronunciations are WRONG......
2016-09-01 22:54:52	DaPinkOne	pyon, that might be why it was taking so long. also, japanese tv doesn't have closed captioning?
2016-09-01 22:54:52	kosan	If it's a slice of life, you can probably watch it without audio and get the gist of it :P

2016-09-01 22:55:14	pyon	IceFireXD: :-p
2016-09-01 22:55:23	IceFireXD	if it's something like, say, fafner? yeah.... subs are 100% necessary.
2016-09-01 22:55:49	DaPinkOne	pyon, closed captioning is written text at the bottom of the screen(subs) for the deaf, so they can enjoy television. most television networks do this by default with varying levels of accuracy.
2016-09-01 22:55:50	IceFireXD	pyon: closed captioning = TV for the deaf.
2016-09-01 22:56:16	pyon	DaPinkOne: IceFireXD: Ah, no idea.

2016-09-05 22:40:36	warsh	that's subjective
2016-09-05 22:40:43	warsh	some ppl prefer java over python
2016-09-05 22:40:59	Faika	When I think of compiled I think that it's more organized.
2016-09-05 22:41:01	warsh	java being compiled, python being interpreted 
2016-09-05 22:41:03	Fenderbassist	warsh: Mushishi Zoku Shou, Ergo Proxy, Log Horizon, Darker Than Black (a couple repeats in there)

2016-09-05 22:55:24	Terminus	meanwhile, our president here was being stupid again and obama just cancelled a meeting with him. all i can do is laugh.

2016-09-05 22:57:48	Smeef	Terminus, there were also a couple blizzards that no one took seriously that buried the city for a couple weeks, garbage was rotting under the snow and cars were frozen under snowbanks, and there wasn't enough rock salt for the trucks

2016-09-09 13:29:16	pineappleclock	I was doing a keto diet and it requires a certain level of potassium supplementation
2016-09-09 13:29:55	pineappleclock	and since the US FDA has retarded laws for K suppliments in pill-form, I had to use salt substitute
2016-09-09 13:30:43	amigojapan	pineappleclock: salt literally increases your blood pressure almost instantly after taking a large ammount
2016-09-09 13:31:41	amigojapan	Fenderbassist: the farmasist told me I can take one teaspoon of salt per day with my condition :(
2016-09-09 13:31:52	pineappleclock	US RDA for potassium is 4,700mg / day, but suppliments are capped at 99mg

2016-09-09 13:40:35	sirius0503	or so it goes
2016-09-09 13:40:40	pineappleclock	there are probably genes that reduce the desire to smoke
2016-09-09 13:40:40	KaffeeJunky123	and it's possible that certain traits are mutually exclusive

2016-09-09 13:51:45	pineappleclock	so maybe your sense of salt will normalize in the future
2016-09-09 13:52:31	amigojapan	pineappleclock: I see, thanks
2016-09-09 13:53:15	KaffeeJunky123	YetiMaster5000: he should notice soon if it helps
2016-09-09 13:53:30	KaffeeJunky123	According to research there's people who strongly respond to salt and those who don't 
2016-09-09 13:53:43	KaffeeJunky123	You can only find out by trying
2016-09-09 13:53:56	KaffeeJunky123	And there's no risk in reducing salt usually
2016-09-09 13:54:31	pineappleclock	or watch some Clannad and season your food with tears
2016-09-09 13:54:46	sirius0503	too many tears in clannad
2016-09-09 13:54:49	KaffeeJunky123	pineappleclock: he'll become dehydrated!

2016-09-09 13:55:26	amigojapan	meantime we were chatting I ate a whole lemon with tons of pepper... I did not know one could just eat lemon :)
2016-09-09 13:55:35	theholyduck	KaffeeJunky123: the fuku arc is so bad
2016-09-09 13:55:38	sirius0503	somewhat like the stupid repeated summer in haruhi suzumiya
2016-09-09 13:55:49	theholyduck	she is like a 1 dimensional charracter
2016-09-09 13:55:54	theholyduck	and the entire arc is written so badly

2016-09-09 13:56:17	theholyduck	in terms of just awful writing

2016-09-09 13:56:28	amigojapan	sirius0503: the summer festival in Haruhi is the Tanabata Matsuri, we celebrate it for real

2016-09-09 13:57:12	KaffeeJunky123	of the endless summer
2016-09-09 13:57:14	pineappleclock	it's 1,2 -> 8
2016-09-09 13:57:38	KaffeeJunky123	pineappleclock: it's vital to watch them all
2016-09-09 13:57:39	YetiMaster5000	What do you mean "could just eat lemon" amigojapan?

2016-09-09 13:57:43	pineappleclock	lol what
2016-09-09 13:57:57	amigojapan	except for endless 8, I believe in watching haruhi in the original airing schedule
2016-09-09 13:58:07	KaffeeJunky123	pineappleclock: for example, robot gal gets a different mask every time
2016-09-09 13:58:14	KaffeeJunky123	there's many small differences

2016-09-09 13:58:51	theholyduck	well the original tv airing schedule for s1 is definitly the corrrect order.
2016-09-09 13:58:56	KaffeeJunky123	pineappleclock: also, you need to reset your memory every time, so you get the feeling of the characters right

2016-09-09 14:01:36	brainwash	I don't like haruhi. however, I have to admit that the movie was quite good.
2016-09-09 14:01:38	theholyduck	theres 1 entire novel dedicated to the filming of the movie.
2016-09-09 14:01:53	theholyduck	and after that it goes into just doing short stories
2016-09-09 14:02:00	theholyduck	and the rest of s1 is just a random sampling of those short stories
2016-09-09 14:02:14	theholyduck	but you couldnt make the anime in that order.
2016-09-09 14:02:28	theholyduck	so. starting with a short story and then gradually doing the first novel was the right choice
2016-09-09 14:02:35	pineappleclock	there's plenty of doujinshi to catch up on after the main story concludes though

2016-09-09 15:37:38	theholyduck	pyon: its a function of poverty and childhood mortality.
2016-09-09 15:37:48	pyon	And certain people can't be trusted to use their reproductive rights in a responsible way.
2016-09-09 15:38:23	theholyduck	people who are educated. with a decent job and a decent life generally wont have many children because they wonnnt need children to support them

2016-09-09 15:41:19	beaky	lol
2016-09-09 15:41:45	pyon	theholyduck: The only other possibility I can think of is to revoke their human rights without taking away their right to reproduce, but I think modern society doesn't condone slavery.

2016-09-09 17:44:25	bagelsan	do you have issue with it?
2016-09-09 17:44:40	Blink`	Avonis - Yeah, which is why I question stuff, but if I really want to learn the meaning, I have to directly learn it. Otherwise I'd know how to speak japanese by now strictly through anime :D

2016-09-09 17:51:12	Avonis	ahh the french coast

2016-09-09 23:11:58	paenitentia	but you shouldnt drink 8, doses for the other things in them are worse
2016-09-09 23:12:53	paenitentia	and after a while the acid can hurt your stomach

I have a local anime database which contains title aliases, start times, number of episodes, etc. from anidb and other anime sites. It uses all that information to determine which matching series the torrent most likely corresponds to.

2016-09-10 22:09:27	crutchy	using drugs to supress symptoms of depression is no better than using waifus
2016-09-10 22:09:44	spoonm	but those who do so for reasons most people find odd, idiotic or nonsensical usually fall in that category

2016-09-10 22:11:18	crutchy	pyon, much things probably dont make sense to an atheist
2016-09-10 22:11:30	pyon	crutchy: I'm not even an atheist.

2016-09-10 22:12:54	ezekielnoob	pyon i think the problem on what you are saying is how do you measure if somebody is mentally ill or not?
2016-09-10 22:12:59	pyon	crutchy: That's okay. Science doesn't answer questions about morals and human relations. Some religions have pretty good answers to those things.
2016-09-10 22:13:09	crutchy	true
2016-09-10 22:13:28	crutchy	everyone can debate them. thats healthy
2016-09-10 22:13:43	pyon	crutchy: But I'm pretty sure science can answer the question whether it's a good idea to hang yourself if you don't want to die.
2016-09-10 22:13:44	crutchy	theres probably no right or werong answers though
2016-09-10 22:13:50	pyon	Heck, not even science, just plain common sense.
2016-09-10 22:14:01	crutchy	'common sense' is of course relative
2016-09-10 22:14:10	otakucheetah	maybe I'll just start watching a new series.. 
2016-09-10 22:14:13	crutchy	to whatever is considered 'common'
2016-09-10 22:14:33	crutchy	along with common sense, there is also a lot of common stupidity
2016-09-10 22:15:17	crutchy	it depends largely on your upbringing and cultural and social environment
2016-09-10 22:15:29	crutchy	which varies wildly around the world
2016-09-10 22:15:45	jrg	goddamn. japanese guy is beating the mexican up lol
2016-09-10 22:15:56	beaky	you mean the macaque?
2016-09-10 22:16:00	beaky	oh different vid
2016-09-10 22:16:26	pyon	crutchy: In what culture is it normal to hang yourself to because you want to “go halfway to heaven and then come back”?
2016-09-10 22:16:54	crutchy	i don't know. but to the samurai suicide was a norla thing
2016-09-10 22:16:56	pyon	I don't think such a culture could've survived for long.
2016-09-10 22:16:57	crutchy	*normal
2016-09-10 22:17:16	pyon	crutchy: Samurai who commit seppuku are really trying to kill themselves, though.
2016-09-10 22:17:22	crutchy	just because we in "the west" don't consider suicide to be normal doesn't hold much water
2016-09-10 22:17:36	crutchy	i'm just saying that because we don't understand it doesn't mean there's no reason
2016-09-10 22:17:52	crutchy	our worldview obviously differs to theirs
2016-09-10 22:17:52	vash	there has to be a basic faculty for reasoning that all non-mentally-challenged people have... in common
2016-09-10 22:18:00	pyon	crutchy: No, suicide is pretty normal. That's okay. If someone has legitimate reaosns for ending their life, who's anyone else to stop them?
2016-09-10 22:18:31	crutchy	pyon, i'm sure it doesn't surprise you that people around the world have different ideas of what death is
2016-09-10 22:18:54	crutchy	open your mind a bit more buddy
2016-09-10 22:19:11	vash	i'm with both of you on this one
2016-09-10 22:19:23	pyon	One can have a reasonable conversation with someone who believes in the afterlife. But I don't think it's possible to have a reasonable conversation with someone who believes they can be revived in this world.
2016-09-10 22:19:45	vash	well
2016-09-10 22:19:52	vash	that happens pretty often pyon 
2016-09-10 22:20:12	crutchy	pyon, depends on your definition of revival. some people have literally been pronounced dead and buried. and then exhumed with signs of scratch marks on the underside of the coffin lid
2016-09-10 22:20:12	pyon	Well, not counting those cases where someone's, like, clinically dead for 30 minutes, then revived.
2016-09-10 22:20:32	vash	pretty sure that's what that 25 year old girl thought would happen, pyon 
2016-09-10 22:20:47	beaky	i want 25yo gf
2016-09-10 22:20:50	spoonm	crutchy: those cases are pretty fucking creepy
2016-09-10 22:20:59	spoonm	I imagine the families are haunted by nightmares
2016-09-10 22:21:01	crutchy	pyon, and also medical science has been working on the very issue of revival
2016-09-10 22:21:21	crutchy	to try to save people that would normally have been pronounced dead
2016-09-10 22:21:45	beaky	this revival talk reminds me of this fun game http://www.philosophyexperiments.com/stayingalive/Default.aspx

2016-09-10 22:22:02	beaky	(i always end up dying everytime i retake it haha)
2016-09-10 22:22:08	ezekielnoob	imagine if we have the technology to upload your consciousness into another simulation, i think that's a good alternative to suciide
2016-09-10 22:22:24	⚡	ezekielnoob liks to promote vr
2016-09-10 22:22:33	pyon	ezekielnoob: That would be terrible. If I die, I'd like to stay dead.
2016-09-10 22:22:40	ezekielnoob	that's you
2016-09-10 22:22:43	crutchy	pyon, i kinda agree that it seems insane, but only because i've probably grown up in a similar society to you
2016-09-10 22:22:54	pyon	crutchy: Pretty sure we haven't grown up in similar societies.
2016-09-10 22:22:58	ezekielnoob	although to me, i'd like to be dead when i die too
2016-09-10 22:23:03	vash	idk, i want to get my head vitrified
2016-09-10 22:23:23	vash	so they can put me in a robot body in the future, when my genius will be appreciated
2016-09-10 22:23:29	crutchy	pyon, whatever. apparently there are some commonalities that attribute suicide with the hope of revival to some measure of insanity
2016-09-10 22:24:01	pyon	crutchy: I wouldn't call it “insanity”. It's plain stupidity.
2016-09-10 22:24:13	pyon	I mean, insanity can make you do stupid things, but not all stupid people are insane.
2016-09-10 22:24:17	crutchy	whatever you call it
2016-09-10 22:24:19	pyon	Insanity is a clinical condition. Stupidity is not.
2016-09-10 22:24:29	ezekielnoob	how can you determine that
2016-09-10 22:24:31	vash	i think we can all walk away with the same, clear and obvious lesson
2016-09-10 22:24:34	vash	religion is dangerous
2016-09-10 22:24:42	pyon	vash: Nah. Religion is fine.
2016-09-10 22:24:42	crutchy	insandity is just another desciption of a bunch of symptoms. similar to depression

2016-09-10 22:24:53	Nanobot	I died once. I opened my eyes, and there was Jesus, Buddha, the freaky multi-everything guy from Hinduism, and George Carlin. Apparently they were all just as confused as I was. Then a platypus waddled over and pushed me back off the cloud, and I fell back into my body.
2016-09-10 22:24:55	AndroidAnaMaico	PEACE
2016-09-10 22:25:16	beaky	wow is that your haibane dream Nanobot 
2016-09-10 22:25:17	vash	pyon: it makes people believe bullshit like they can die and say goodbye to their dead best friend and then come back
2016-09-10 22:25:23	ezekielnoob	that's it.... lol
2016-09-10 22:25:27	crutchy	stupidity is something that doesn't have much meaning in the medical world. its just a common insult
2016-09-10 22:25:35	otakucheetah	hi beaky 
2016-09-10 22:25:42	beaky	hello cheeta
2016-09-10 22:25:50	pyon	vash: That isn't religion's fault. Most religious people don't do that kind of shit.
2016-09-10 22:25:53	paenitentia	the obvious lesson is that arguing on #anime about things that are not anime is generally a bad idea
2016-09-10 22:26:02	crutchy	paenitentia, nah its fun
2016-09-10 22:26:03	vash	pyon: but they believe the same underlying fantasy
2016-09-10 22:26:14	ezekielnoob	well there are different levels
2016-09-10 22:26:14	AndroidAnaMaico	But Vash the Stampede is basically Jesus with a bigass revolver.
2016-09-10 22:26:15	crutchy	can only jabber on about anime for so long
2016-09-10 22:26:21	ezekielnoob	i agree on pyon on that
2016-09-10 22:26:36	crutchy	pyon, religious people do all kinds of shit
2016-09-10 22:26:44	pyon	crutchy: Some religious people, of course.
2016-09-10 22:26:49	crutchy	atheists also do
2016-09-10 22:26:53	pyon	crutchy: Some nonreligious people do all kinds of shit, too.
2016-09-10 22:26:55	vash	yeah for sure
2016-09-10 22:27:10	crutchy	for example, some atheists go waaaaay out of their way to belittle religion. if they didn't care, why do they care so much?
2016-09-10 22:27:13	otakucheetah	I want 25 y/o gf too... gonna move to japan and get christmas cake gf
2016-09-10 22:27:22	vash	but atheism doesn't encourage people to fritter away this life because fuck it, why not, they have eternity waiting
2016-09-10 22:27:29	pyon	crutchy: Atheists are arguing for their own religion, in which there is no God.

2016-09-10 22:31:36	ezekielnoob	i think a lot of people though that dropped religion goes into the "angry atheist" stage
2016-09-10 22:31:59	crutchy	ezekielnoob, i don't label myself with any *ism
2016-09-10 22:31:59	ezekielnoob	then it dies down into not giving a fuck anymore

2016-09-10 22:32:32	pyon	ezekielnoob: Atheists are perhaps one of the most religious groups of people I've met (IRL).
2016-09-10 22:32:41	paenitentia	them and vegans
2016-09-10 22:32:54	crutchy	putting yourself into an *ism camp opens you up to people misrepresenting the dogma surrounding that *ism
2016-09-10 22:32:55	ezekielnoob	i used to be one
2016-09-10 22:32:56	vash	sometimes they are... evangelical about it
2016-09-10 22:33:03	ezekielnoob	yeah
2016-09-10 22:33:11	pyon	ezekielnoob: Here most people are Catholics. Yet they don't attend mass or follow Jesus teachings or anything. But atheists follow atheism's principles everyday in their lives.

2016-09-10 22:34:03	BillyZane	they are selling chocolate covered almonds at the local grocery store inside of a bin. they also have lemon creme almonds. 
2016-09-10 22:34:12	crutchy	i think i went to church a handful of times when i was really young
2016-09-10 22:34:24	vash	i understand it, the need to try to make people see things the way you do
2016-09-10 22:34:32	BillyZane	this morning i grabbed 3 out of the bin without paying for it and just snacked on it. it was so good, i wish i bought some
2016-09-10 22:34:33	pyon	paenitentia: Atheism's main principle is that people who believe in some sort of divine being are Untermenschen.

2016-09-10 22:37:49	crutchy	everyone has their own beliefs. whether they choose to make them known or even acknoledge them or not. faith is natural

2016-09-10 22:38:37	pyon	crutchy: That isn't faith. That's just being civilized.
2016-09-10 22:38:44	crutchy	nope. its faith
2016-09-10 22:39:02	crutchy	there are plenty of uncivilized people driving on the roads around me
2016-09-10 22:39:06	pyon	crutchy: It's only faith if it can't be experimentally confirmed.
2016-09-10 22:39:12	crutchy	andd it cant
2016-09-10 22:39:14	ezekielnoob	atleast the topic is not suicide anymore
2016-09-10 22:39:34	ezekielnoob	i'll jsut wait for the latest Re:zero
2016-09-10 22:39:37	ezekielnoob	a lot of hours left
2016-09-10 22:39:38	vash	BillyZane, i think my gf wants to move in
2016-09-10 22:39:40	crutchy	you can't prove that everyone i encounter on the road will remain on their side of the road at all times
2016-09-10 22:39:47	BillyZane	vash, really 
2016-09-10 22:40:00	BillyZane	vash, what ever happened to hope and that other girl..
2016-09-10 22:40:00	pyon	crutchy: You only need that to hold in a statistical sense.
2016-09-10 22:40:14	ezekielnoob	faith in statistics i guess
2016-09-10 22:40:18	crutchy	relying on statistics is also faith
2016-09-10 22:40:20	ezekielnoob	it's a good faith
2016-09-10 22:40:26	ezekielnoob	reasonable
2016-09-10 22:40:27	crutchy	statistics by definition deals with uncertainty
2016-09-10 22:40:31	vash	BillyZane: i mean, they're still around, but i broke it off with tina and then hope
2016-09-10 22:40:50	pyon	crutchy: Of course you're dealing with uncertainty. But it's reasonable to take decisions based on the most probable outcome.
2016-09-10 22:40:56	ezekielnoob	man there's so much political talk in my country right now
2016-09-10 22:41:01	ezekielnoob	i'm so sick of it

2016-09-10 22:41:08	crutchy	words like "reasonable" don't discount the faith aspect
2016-09-10 22:41:21	BillyZane	vash, daing. it's the right decision. seems your new girl is  someone you like a lot more
2016-09-10 22:41:24	crutchy	i can have 'reasonable faith'
2016-09-10 22:41:39	vash	BillyZane: they're gonna be at my cousin's wedding, and lol.. i'm totally gonna bring katelyn
2016-09-10 22:41:45	beaky	i wish i had gf

2016-09-10 22:41:52	ezekielnoob	i have faith in scientists that they aren't lying on some things
2016-09-10 22:41:59	ezekielnoob	ofcourse i could be wrong
2016-09-10 22:42:14	crutchy	a lot of scientists are aware of that and use it to their advantage
2016-09-10 22:42:21	beaky	how can i have faith in my own reasoning
2016-09-10 22:42:30	crutchy	beaky, be confident man!
2016-09-10 22:42:32	beaky	(the very same reasoning i use to justify any faith)
2016-09-10 22:42:33	vash	but yea dude, we've been spending a lot of time spun up in each other BillyZane 
2016-09-10 22:42:37	ezekielnoob	so instead of my doing verifications by my self, i just put trust in it
2016-09-10 22:42:55	beaky	is confidence faith in myself
2016-09-10 22:42:58	pyon	crutchy: I wouldn't call modern theoretical physics “science”, though. Most of it is wild conjecturing nowadays.
2016-09-10 22:43:37	paenitentia	y do black holes be like they do
2016-09-10 22:43:40	pyon	crutchy: But there are still scientists who do real science, e.g., molecular biologists.
2016-09-10 22:43:40	vash	2 months sounds like a fine time for living together but idk, it feels a little too soon
2016-09-10 22:43:41	crutchy	pyon, science has been politicized throughout history. its not limited to anything modern

2016-09-10 22:43:54	BillyZane	vash, a lot of time spun up in each other?
2016-09-10 22:44:06	crutchy	i have a lot of faith in the scientific method
2016-09-10 22:44:11	ezekielnoob	i mean
2016-09-10 22:44:35	ezekielnoob	believing in multiverse is .. you know
2016-09-10 22:44:50	crutchy	but we don't normally see the scientific method. only the interpretation of results (which can be subjective or misleading)
2016-09-10 22:44:54	pyon	crutchy: And real science doesn't require faith in anything other than humanity's ability to understand the world if we try hard enough and look at all the data available.
2016-09-10 22:45:25	ezekielnoob	well that's why it's named theoretical physics i suppose
2016-09-10 22:45:31	crutchy	pyon, there is huge amount of faith relied on for any ability of humanity
2016-09-10 22:45:41	crutchy	ability to understand is no exception
2016-09-10 22:46:31	crutchy	even assumptions of the experimental process are driven by understanding, hence the saying "garbage in = garbage out"
2016-09-10 22:46:49	vash	BillyZane: idk how else to put it, the rest of the world feeling like it's less important
2016-09-10 22:46:55	ezekielnoob	i suppose we are trying to interchangably use the word Confidence and Faith
2016-09-10 22:47:07	pyon	ezekielnoob: I wouldn't interchangeably use those words.
2016-09-10 22:47:18	pyon	Faith is about what can't be confirmed. Ever.
2016-09-10 22:47:31	pyon	Confidence is about what you don't know yet.
2016-09-10 22:47:34	BillyZane	vash, interesting 
2016-09-10 22:47:35	crutchy	human ability can never be confirmed
2016-09-10 22:47:57	pyon	crutchy: Mind you, I've never said that we'll ever understand the world perfectly. Believing that would require faith.
2016-09-10 22:48:03	beaky	if that can never be confirmed, doesnt that mean we know nothing
2016-09-10 22:48:17	pyon	crutchy: But it's a fact that we understand the world to some extent, and that science has made it possible. That doesn't require faith. It's a historical fact.
2016-09-10 22:48:23	beaky	(yet clearly we do know things!)
2016-09-10 22:48:55	beaky	pyon wasn't there a lot of faith in newton's laws
2016-09-10 22:48:55	crutchy	pyon, its easy to trust what we can personally readily observe
2016-09-10 22:49:00	crutchy	the rest comes down to faith
2016-09-10 22:49:04	beaky	and then special relativity happened
2016-09-10 22:49:13	crutchy	(since we can't personally confirm)
2016-09-10 22:49:25	vash	BillyZane: how about "up each other's ass" you know that one?
2016-09-10 22:49:36	crutchy	i trust the laws of gravity, because i experience them daily
2016-09-10 22:49:43	crutchy	i can do a simple test
2016-09-10 22:49:49	crutchy	to check their validity
2016-09-10 22:50:12	crutchy	but the reason i don't is because i have a lot of faith in them
2016-09-10 22:50:24	crutchy	they pass the sniff test
2016-09-10 22:50:26	beaky	what kind of simple test can you do crutchy 
2016-09-10 22:50:34	BillyZane	 vash, umm.... no i don't think i've ever said that phrase
2016-09-10 22:50:36	pyon	beaky: Special relativity doesn't deny the validity of Newtonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics arises as a special case, when objects move at speeds a lot slower than the speed of light.
2016-09-10 22:50:39	beaky	the ones in physics class all say 'assume a perfect vacuum'
2016-09-10 22:50:48	crutchy	measure a fall parameters in a drop test
2016-09-10 22:51:15	vash	BillyZane: really? 
2016-09-10 22:51:22	crutchy	vacuum is only required for the theory. in reality the accuracy and resolution of your instruments will probably render a vacuum uneccesary
2016-09-10 22:51:38	BillyZane	vash, well, i invited denise right now to see if she wants to eat dinner with me. (i made it seem that way but in reality i'm inviting her to come with a bunch of my friends to eat out). this might be a bad idea. we're still in the friend zone with each other. i need to get her alone so i can tell her i like her etc.
2016-09-10 22:52:13	vash	idk, i don't believe in the friend zone
2016-09-10 22:52:19	beaky	what is the friend zone
2016-09-10 22:52:34	crutchy	beaky, its where you get to see but not touch
2016-09-10 22:52:35	beaky	pyon didn't it take a while for empirical evidence to validate special relativity too
2016-09-10 22:52:56	vash	friends are awesome assets and girls are good friends for guys to have, sometimes things become more, sometimes they never will, that's ok too they will fix you up with their friends if you're actually a good friend
2016-09-10 22:53:09	pyon	beaky: Of course.
2016-09-10 22:53:40	pyon	beaky: But these days theoretical physicists formulate theories that would be very difficult to experimentally confirm even in principle.
2016-09-10 22:53:44	beaky	so einstein had to rely on faith
2016-09-10 22:53:55	pyon	beaky: No, he had to rely on physical intuition.
2016-09-10 22:53:59	beaky	and that faith paid off
2016-09-10 22:53:59	crutchy	i think there is a hellava lot of faith in einstin
2016-09-10 22:54:04	crutchy	*einstein
2016-09-10 22:54:14	beaky	what is 'physical intuition' if not faith
2016-09-10 22:54:16	pyon	crutchy: There is indeed a lot of faith in Einstein. And that's one of the negative aspects of his fame.
2016-09-10 22:54:25	BillyZane	vash, i think we're in an undeclared zone. i think she understands my intentions and i think i see hers. she gets a lot of favors for guys without having to put out anything and i think she understands i won't be her sugar daddy if she's going to play that game with other guys. is it wrong that i don't want to pay for any of her shit or meals if she's talking to other guys?
2016-09-10 22:54:32	crutchy	pyon, true. one day einstein may well be proven wrong
2016-09-10 22:54:35	vash	there's a good bit of doubt too, this is why the entire field of quantum mechanics exists, pyon, crutchy 
2016-09-10 22:54:37	crutchy	who knows
2016-09-10 22:54:41	AndroidAnaMaico	Einstein believed in God.
2016-09-10 22:54:58	AndroidAnaMaico	DEAL WITH IT
2016-09-10 22:55:09	vash	you'd have to ask him AndroidAnaMaico, people say he believed in god, people say he didn't
2016-09-10 22:56:01	AndroidAnaMaico	Eh he historically believed in god until Athiest counterpoints caught on in the 2000s
2016-09-10 22:56:02	+Moyst	It's 'atheist'.
2016-09-10 22:56:42	vash	he has quotes like "God doesn't play dice with the universe" but also quotes like "I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."
2016-09-10 22:57:01	vash	so no
2016-09-10 22:57:04	vash	you are just entirely wrong
2016-09-10 22:57:05	AndroidAnaMaico	It's like all atheism constitutes is a religion of arguing 
2016-09-10 22:57:11	crutchy	i dunno if god really is what many people (particularly atheists) think he is
2016-09-10 22:57:26	crutchy	i think of god as a more personal or natural thing
2016-09-10 22:57:34	crutchy	well, not 'thing'
2016-09-10 22:57:37	AndroidAnaMaico	Um your quote does not confirm anything Vash
2016-09-10 22:57:39	crutchy	concept maybe
2016-09-10 22:57:42	AndroidAnaMaico	I could still be right
2016-09-10 22:57:44	vash	BillyZane: sorry, distracted. it's not wrong
2016-09-10 22:57:58	vash	AndroidAnaMaico: you won't take the man's own word?
2016-09-10 22:58:31	AndroidAnaMaico	His statement does not deny a belief of a sort
2016-09-10 22:58:34	BillyZane	well, i'm probably going to tell her all this some time soon
2016-09-10 22:58:38	crutchy	god is just the personalization of an otherwise abstract concept of the unexplained
2016-09-10 22:58:38	AndroidAnaMaico	It's complex
2016-09-10 22:58:42	vash	not really
2016-09-10 22:58:46	vash	it's pretty clear
2016-09-10 22:59:02	crutchy	or some shit
2016-09-10 22:59:14	crutchy	different people likely have different ideas of what god is
2016-09-10 22:59:20	BillyZane	no it's not entirely clear. i haven't told her abouy any girls i might be dating. she has seen me with other girls, she might think i'm dating other girls right now and only view her as a friend
2016-09-10 22:59:26	AndroidAnaMaico	Come on Vash, didn't you learn anything from deep anime? Everything can have multiple layers and interpretations and dimensions
2016-09-10 22:59:35	vash	it seems to me like it's religious counterpoints from the 2000s
2016-09-10 22:59:48	AndroidAnaMaico	Hey that goes both ways
2016-09-10 22:59:57	vash	catching on and assigning faith to a man who clearly says "i do not believe in a personal god"
2016-09-10 23:00:06	vash	never denied it, expressed it clearly
2016-09-10 23:00:18	crutchy	vash, loads of quotes are taken out of context though
2016-09-10 23:00:19	AndroidAnaMaico	He has to specify personal though
2016-09-10 23:00:21	vash	the only religious thing in him was an admiration for the world
2016-09-10 23:00:39	vash	lol
2016-09-10 23:00:42	vash	let's lawyer it
2016-09-10 23:00:49	vash	as i said at the beginning
2016-09-10 23:00:53	crutchy	whats the context of that quote?
2016-09-10 23:00:56	vash	ash ╡ you'd have to ask him AndroidAnaMaico, people say he believed in god, people say he didn't 
2016-09-10 23:01:20	AndroidAnaMaico	Just don't get too anal retentive about it
2016-09-10 23:01:31	crutchy	also vash, if einstein would have to be asked it kinda implies you don't know what he meant either
2016-09-10 23:01:35	beaky	i have faith in azusa
2016-09-10 23:01:39	AndroidAnaMaico	I actually do not enjoy arguing. I do it out of abligation.
2016-09-10 23:01:42	beaky	as the perfect 2d girl
2016-09-10 23:01:53	vash	crutchy: correct
2016-09-10 23:01:55	beaky	should i commit suicide to be with azusa in the afterlife
2016-09-10 23:02:05	ezekielnoob	only a nice 2d picture will end this conversation
2016-09-10 23:02:18	AndroidAnaMaico	If it were up to me, I would rather mind-meld with you Vash, and show you the Matrix
2016-09-10 23:02:23	vash	crutchy: it's generally accepted that einstein was a pantheist, believed in spinoza's god
2016-09-10 23:02:44	crutchy	tbh i've never cared much about einstein to find out much about him
2016-09-10 23:02:59	vash	i'm not arguing what i believe, crutchy
2016-09-10 23:03:08	vash	i'm arguing the opposite of what AndroidAnaMaico asserted
2016-09-10 23:03:13	crutchy	oh no i can see that
2016-09-10 23:03:16	AndroidAnaMaico	That's annoying
2016-09-10 23:03:17	crutchy	yeah
2016-09-10 23:03:32	crutchy	'devil's advocate'
2016-09-10 23:03:46	vash	AndroidAnaMaico: too bad, don't make blanket assertions about things that aren't necessarily so
2016-09-10 23:04:01	vash	that is annoying to me
2016-09-10 23:04:02	AndroidAnaMaico	Arguing in general is annoying and counter-productive anyway.
2016-09-10 23:04:03	crutchy	i love playing devil's advocate
2016-09-10 23:04:10	vash	not really
2016-09-10 23:04:17	crutchy	i think its because it pisses people off that i like it so much. am i evil?
2016-09-10 23:04:24	vash	without argument, all you have is blind group thinking
2016-09-10 23:04:31	vash	a gigantic circlejerk
2016-09-10 23:04:45	AndroidAnaMaico	Vash by arguing with me you have solidified my resolve that arguing is annoying
2016-09-10 23:04:52	vash	crutchy: it means you are good
2016-09-10 23:04:57	crutchy	AndroidAnaMaico, then stop arguing
2016-09-10 23:05:05	vash	yeah, concede
2016-09-10 23:05:08	AndroidAnaMaico	The more you argue with me, the more it works against you
2016-09-10 23:05:15	vash	AndroidAnaMaico
2016-09-10 23:05:17	vash	surrender
2016-09-10 23:05:20	crutchy	funny thing about an argument... it usually requires two parties
2016-09-10 23:05:26	beaky	surrender to the power of cute
2016-09-10 23:05:28	beaky	and watch k-on!
2016-09-10 23:05:41	ezekielnoob	cuuuute

2016-09-10 23:05:59	AndroidAnaMaico	If I surrender, you will feel as though you have won. I am not going to encourage you to argue by making you think you have won.
2016-09-10 23:06:13	vash	i know i have won
2016-09-10 23:06:14	ezekielnoob	this is the problem with arguing
2016-09-10 23:06:14	vash	i assert it
2016-09-10 23:06:19	crutchy	AndroidAnaMaico, so you're gunna keep annoying yourself by arguing?
2016-09-10 23:06:24	ezekielnoob	people feel obliged to win
2016-09-10 23:06:34	vash	AndroidAnaMaico: if you don't feel i have won, argue with me about it
2016-09-10 23:06:48	ezekielnoob	whenever i argue i do consider myself trying to learn from the other person
2016-09-10 23:06:48	AndroidAnaMaico	If it means denying Vash the harmful pride he wants, I will argue for two days.
2016-09-10 23:07:00	crutchy	someone start a timer
2016-09-10 23:07:07	ezekielnoob	stop the train
2016-09-10 23:07:08	vash	you couldn't make an iota of a difference in my pride
2016-09-10 23:07:13	crutchy	this requires utmost attention to precision
2016-09-10 23:07:24	⚡	ezekielnoob prepares the tables

2016-09-10 23:36:18	vash	Once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river. The current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and old, rich and poor, good and evil -- the current going its own way, knowing only its own crystal self.
2016-09-10 23:36:34	vash	Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, and resisting the current was what each had learned from birth.
2016-09-10 23:36:49	vash	But one creature said at last, "I am tired of clinging. Though I cannot see it with my eyes, I trust that the current knows where it is going. I shall let go, and let it take me where it will. Clinging, I shall die of boredom."
2016-09-10 23:37:15	vash	The other creatures laughed and said, "Fool! Let go, and that current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed against the rocks, and you will die quicker than of boredom!"
2016-09-10 23:37:28	vash	But the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go, and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks.
2016-09-10 23:38:01	vash	the end
2016-09-10 23:38:04	vash	jk
2016-09-10 23:38:06	vash	Yet in time, as the creature refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from the bottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more.
2016-09-10 23:38:18	vash	And the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried, "See a miracle! A creature like ourselves, yet he flies! See the messiah, come to save us all!"
2016-09-10 23:38:29	vash	And the one carried in the current said, "I am no more messiah than you. The river delights to lift us free, if only we dare let go. Our true work is this voyage, this adventure."
2016-09-10 23:38:38	vash	But they cried the more, "Savior!" all the while clinging to the rocks, and when they looked again he was gone, and they were left alone making legends of a savior.
2016-09-10 23:40:29	AndroidAnaMaico	Makes me want to read short stories again.

2016-09-11 01:27:32	pteague	i guess what i was pointing at was look at things from somebody that thinks anime is just kids cartoons ... how far do you have to get into a series before it's not a kids cartoon? black lagoon it's the 1st episode ... almost everything else i've seen it's several episodes before an episode starts getting serious

2016-09-11 16:01:27	bagelsan	paenitentia, its not exactly legal to use someones credit card without permission
2016-09-11 16:01:40	TsundereNoises	but the problem wasn't the legality
2016-09-11 16:01:45	paenitentia	less than illegal if its your parents card
2016-09-11 16:02:02	TsundereNoises	the police don't take away your laptop
2016-09-11 16:02:10	TsundereNoises	well...
2016-09-11 16:02:15	bagelsan	less than illegal? her parents could of filed charges
2016-09-11 16:02:23	paenitentia	if they do you have bigger problems TsundereNoises 
2016-09-11 16:02:23	bagelsan	TsundereNoises, her parents took the computer away
2016-09-11 16:02:36	theholyduck	bagelsan: depending on your age. you might not be legaly culpable
2016-09-11 16:02:46	TsundereNoises	Yeah, that's my point, that's a parental punishment, not a legal one
2016-09-11 16:02:47	theholyduck	or whatever the term is
2016-09-11 16:02:50	pyon	Using your own parents' credit cards without permission is pretty stupid, lemme say.
2016-09-11 16:02:57	theholyduck	oh totally
2016-09-11 16:02:57	paenitentia	true
2016-09-11 16:03:06	bagelsan	theholyduck, in the states she could easily be charged
2016-09-11 16:03:09	pyon	I mean, it's their money that feeds you
2016-09-11 16:03:23	pyon	(Assuming you're a teenager who doesn't have a job or any other source of income.)
2016-09-11 16:03:28	TsundereNoises	bagelsan, she already charged, that's the problem
2016-09-11 16:03:40	theholyduck	bagelsan: in norway. if you are under 15 you arent connnsidered mentally able to commit a crime or signn a contract
2016-09-11 16:03:47	bagelsan	LOL
2016-09-11 16:03:58	bagelsan	theholyduck, i wish i was in norway id just rob a bunch of people
2016-09-11 16:03:59	bagelsan	:p
2016-09-11 16:04:05	bagelsan	when i was 15
2016-09-11 16:04:07	theholyduck	bagelsan: oh. you arent imune from punishmennt

2016-09-11 16:04:23	ezekielnoob	lol
2016-09-11 16:04:39	bagelsan	ezekielnoob, talking about credit card fraud
2016-09-11 16:04:40	theholyduck	bagelsan: and odds are your parents would lose custody
2016-09-11 16:04:43	ezekielnoob	oh

2016-09-11 16:04:50	theholyduck	because clearly they arent managing you
2016-09-11 16:05:01	davic	bagelsan: social services case below 15
2016-09-11 16:05:17	bagelsan	theholyduck, sounds weird. custody wont be lost here most likely unless your house is a shit hole and you abuse your kid
2016-09-11 16:05:25	pyon	I'd say the death penalty would be better.
2016-09-11 16:05:27	theholyduck	bagelsan: if your kids is a habitual criminal
2016-09-11 16:05:35	theholyduck	then you failed as a parent
2016-09-11 16:05:42	davic	^
2016-09-11 16:05:42	pyon	Someone who by age 15 hasn't learn how to behave civilizedly isn't fit for living in a modern society.
2016-09-11 16:05:43	ezekielnoob	im not exactly aware of the criminal charges for that but there would be definitelely
2016-09-11 16:05:44	theholyduck	epecially if they are 15 and doing it

2016-09-11 16:06:32	ezekielnoob	that's ironic
2016-09-11 16:06:50	pyon	theholyduck: I'm not sociopathic. I just want to put people in their right place.

2016-09-11 16:08:42	bagelsan	pyon, its not abuse. they are just putting them in their place according to islamic law /s

2016-09-11 16:09:46	bagelsan	pyon, i cant even approach this in a serious manner since im not being serious.
2016-09-11 16:09:52	TsundereNoises	Pyon, what if by putting them in their place you meant a healthy relationship with another woman?
2016-09-11 16:10:09	pyon	TsundereNoises: That only applies to 2D girls.
2016-09-11 16:10:12	U236Willy	a little abuse is ok...
2016-09-11 16:10:15	bagelsan	TsundereNoises, first wife is best wife
2016-09-11 16:10:29	pyon	In any case, these days parents are too soft with their children.
2016-09-11 16:10:44	ezekielnoob	i think they are just being human

2016-09-11 16:44:05	Millennial	well, the animators are skilled
2016-09-11 16:44:10	Millennial	and kyoani's working conditions are better

2016-09-11 16:44:25	beaky	yes k-on! looks so good
2016-09-11 16:44:33	beaky	cute yet serious
2016-09-11 16:44:41	Millennial	and there's this distinct flavor to kyoani shows because they have an actual studio culture
2016-09-11 16:44:45	Millennial	unlike something like a1-pictures
2016-09-11 16:44:55	beaky	and very realistic with its premise of cute girls 
2016-09-11 16:44:57	Millennial	where they bring in different directors and animators for every show, and outsource lots of shit
2016-09-11 16:45:04	beaky	azusa is the cutest
2016-09-11 16:45:22	brainwash	wow. who told you all that?

2016-09-11 16:46:04	Millennial	it's common knowledge that kyoani shows all look the same
2016-09-11 16:46:09	Millennial	and a1-pictures can look wildly different
2016-09-11 16:46:28	Millennial	look at shinsekai yori vs asterisk war, to see how different the aesthetic can be across shows
2016-09-11 16:46:29	beaky	idk clannad looks so different from k-on! and nichijou

2016-09-11 16:49:39	Urchin	it seems like I have to be in a particular mood to pick up a josei title

2016-09-11 16:51:09	Millennial	and i felt like it would be fucking amazing if i watched it in 1080p, so i plan to do that
2016-09-11 16:51:24	brainwash	I fully agree
2016-09-11 16:51:45	Millennial	my problem with shinkai was that he always has these amazing visuals and sound design
2016-09-11 16:51:50	ezekielnoob	my friends were talking about this show
2016-09-11 16:51:52	Millennial	but the stories always felt a little lackluster

2016-09-11 16:53:36	Urchin	MAL would be offering it if it was on CR
2016-09-11 16:53:44	Millennial	and the story is strong in this one, so you really should avoid being hit by any spoilers
2016-09-11 16:53:56	Urchin	Millennial: I don't really have a clue what it's about
2016-09-11 16:54:06	Millennial	it's makoto shinkai
2016-09-11 16:54:09	Millennial	obviously it's about teenage love
2016-09-11 16:54:18	Urchin	I don't know a lot of names
2016-09-11 16:54:22	Millennial	oh :(
2016-09-11 16:54:48	Millennial	brainwash: speaking of pretty visuals
2016-09-11 16:55:06	Millennial	i feel like tales of zestiria is going downhill fast :(
2016-09-11 16:55:15	Millennial	like, it has been going downhill since the first episode
2016-09-11 16:55:25	Urchin	I haven't seen anything of his
2016-09-11 16:55:26	brainwash	not watching this one
2016-09-11 16:55:27	Millennial	but it's becoming more and more apparent that there's no hope that this will be any good
2016-09-11 16:55:34	Millennial	it has amazing visuals
2016-09-11 16:55:39	Millennial	since it's made by ufotable
2016-09-11 16:55:59	Millennial	but that's about it
2016-09-11 16:56:24	brainwash	I don't really care about visuals that much
2016-09-11 16:56:26	Urchin	I was generally uninterested in this season, other than Arslan Senki and Re:Zero
2016-09-11 16:56:36	Millennial	Urchin: arslan senki, oh my fucking god

2016-09-11 16:56:58	Millennial	i had really high expectations from that show
2016-09-11 16:57:03	Millennial	like, before s1 started airing
2016-09-11 16:57:13	Millennial	but the cg soldiers were cringy
2016-09-11 16:57:15	brainwash	Urchin: and food wars?
2016-09-11 16:57:15	Millennial	i kept watching though
2016-09-11 16:57:35	Millennial	and i ended up finishing s2, but i feel like the show is just too cliche
2016-09-11 16:57:48	Millennial	the older adaptation had much more character to it
2016-09-11 16:58:02	Millennial	brainwash: you mean food porn
2016-09-11 16:58:12	brainwash	:D
2016-09-11 16:58:21	ezekielnoob	S2 has less fanservice than s1
2016-09-11 16:58:28	ezekielnoob	which is good
2016-09-11 16:58:30	ezekielnoob	:D
2016-09-11 16:58:44	ezekielnoob	i just like to follow the show, but i always get lost on the cooking part
2016-09-11 16:58:47	Millennial	brainwash: i care about visuals, but visuals alone don't make something good, unfortunately
2016-09-11 16:58:51	ezekielnoob	cause i have no idea what they are talking about
2016-09-11 16:59:00	ezekielnoob	food stuff
2016-09-11 16:59:10	brainwash	Millennial: I watch one piece which has not so good visuals
2016-09-11 16:59:19	Millennial	brainwash: but that's a shonen manga adaptation
2016-09-11 16:59:23	Millennial	a long running one
2016-09-11 16:59:26	brainwash	yeah
2016-09-11 16:59:26	Urchin	Millennial: I would fault it bad fight scenes over the CGI soldiers, but the strategic and political aspects of Arslan Senki are good enough to make it interesting (plus the D&D-ish nature of Arslan's followers is interesting enough)
2016-09-11 16:59:31	Millennial	so you can only have so good visuals

2016-09-11 17:00:10	Millennial	and it's not bad
2016-09-11 17:00:19	Millennial	but it just doesn't go anywhere with its narrative
2016-09-11 17:00:33	Urchin	it's clearly based on Yoshiki Tanaka's novels
2016-09-11 17:00:35	Millennial	and i am getting tired of watching narsus anticipate every single thing that anyone ever does
2016-09-11 17:00:41	brainwash	I've dropped arslan early on

2016-09-11 17:01:04	Millennial	even light and lelouch had stuff they couldn't anticipate beforehand, that's what made death note and code geass exciting
2016-09-11 17:01:27	Urchin	apparently, this is only halfway through the novels, and this is the point where Tanaka tends to start killing off the good guys
2016-09-11 17:01:39	ezekielnoob	well sometimes though the way they get out of trouble can be bullshit Millennial , but i let it slide
2016-09-11 17:01:52	ezekielnoob	i won't be able to enjoy it if i get super critical on the details

2016-09-11 17:02:22	Urchin	Millennial: overall, I don't find it too iffy regarding how much Narsus predicts things
2016-09-11 17:02:24	Millennial	you were supposed to be concerned about this guy storming arslan's castle
2016-09-11 17:02:35	ezekielnoob	i only watched code geass btw
2016-09-11 17:02:35	Millennial	but you just know narsus will never fall for this
2016-09-11 17:02:41	ezekielnoob	i was walking about code geass
2016-09-11 17:02:47	Millennial	so there's no factor of anticipation, you know arslan will win
2016-09-11 17:02:53	Millennial	ezekielnoob: ah
2016-09-11 17:03:02	Millennial	i don't think that there's too much bullshit in code geass
2016-09-11 17:03:05	Millennial	beyond, you know, geass
2016-09-11 17:03:15	Millennial	and some of season 2
2016-09-11 17:03:15	ezekielnoob	the geass is great
2016-09-11 17:03:19	Millennial	it's greatr
2016-09-11 17:03:22	Millennial	but it's bullshit
2016-09-11 17:03:27	Urchin	Millennial: Shagad gave himself off a long time before that point, and plainly, it would be painfully stupid if Narsus *didn't* crush him like he was nothing
2016-09-11 17:03:29	ezekielnoob	my favorite is when he used it to himself
2016-09-11 17:03:32	ezekielnoob	do you remember that?
2016-09-11 17:03:34	Millennial	Urchin: that's true
2016-09-11 17:03:38	Millennial	but why is shagad such a dumbfuck
2016-09-11 17:03:40	ezekielnoob	the Mao vs Lelouch part
2016-09-11 17:03:44	Millennial	ezekielnoob: yes
2016-09-11 17:03:45	Millennial	ofc
2016-09-11 17:04:06	Millennial	but i found this "recording a conversation by anticipating someone's thoughts" thing to be really pushing it
2016-09-11 17:04:09	Urchin	I've started rewatching Code Geass, btw
2016-09-11 17:04:13	Millennial	lelouch didn't even know mao that well
2016-09-11 17:04:21	Millennial	unlike schneizel, which is at least somewhat believable
2016-09-11 17:04:30	Urchin	I've paused after the first five episodes
2016-09-11 17:04:50	Urchin	Code Geass is cool
2016-09-11 17:04:51	Millennial	Urchin: i don't think it's so much that narsus is an OP strategist 
2016-09-11 17:04:58	Millennial	but everyone else is usually just plain stupid
2016-09-11 17:05:09	ezekielnoob	but i really have to give it up to code Geass about the ending of S1 and S2
2016-09-11 17:05:10	Millennial	it would be more interesting if shagad was also a smart guy, you know
2016-09-11 17:05:19	Millennial	or if he at least had something resembling a brain
2016-09-11 17:05:21	ezekielnoob	those were surprising
2016-09-11 17:05:29	Urchin	Millennial: that's the secret of great strategists, from my understanding of military history
2016-09-11 17:05:31	Millennial	ezekielnoob: the ending of S2 was amazing
2016-09-11 17:05:34	ezekielnoob	S2 ending is memorable

2016-09-11 17:05:58	ezekielnoob	very fucked up
2016-09-11 17:06:01	Millennial	the austrians weren't stupid

2016-09-11 17:06:07	Millennial	napoleon was just too much for them to handle
2016-09-11 17:06:14	Millennial	also, the grande armee had half a million men
2016-09-11 17:06:31	Millennial	that is not how it is portrayed in the show, however
2016-09-11 17:06:47	Millennial	it isn't that narsus outsmarts people, people are stupid to begin with, narsus just does what anyone with common sense would choose to do

2016-09-11 17:07:27	Urchin	Millennial: you should really be looking at much earlier periods for a good reference for Arslan Senki
2016-09-11 17:07:47	Urchin	though Arslan Senki is bit of an anachronism stew
2016-09-11 17:07:52	Millennial	we don't have that much detailed information about earlier periods
2016-09-11 17:08:09	Millennial	since ancient writings often exaggerate stuff
2016-09-11 17:08:14	Millennial	and we have to fiigure out what actually happened
2016-09-11 17:08:24	Urchin	given how it's based on the guy from 6th century BCE

2016-09-11 17:08:30	Millennial	true
2016-09-11 17:08:53	Millennial	but beyond all of that, it's that there's no dramatic tension in the story

2016-09-11 17:12:08	Millennial	that's sort of funny, because i always felt the old adaptation of arslan senki and lotgh had a very similar aesthetic to them

2016-09-11 17:15:25	GGLucas	Neither would anything you could spoil about logh be.

2016-09-11 17:15:49	Millennial	i am not watching it because i am lazy
2016-09-11 17:15:50	GGLucas	Alrighty.
2016-09-11 17:15:53	Urchin	ok
2016-09-11 17:16:12	Millennial	and i feel like i have been so out of it that i would have to rewatch some of it to actually get back into what was happening
2016-09-11 17:16:18	Urchin	there are a bunch of shows that I have on hold because my hard drive died while I was watching them

2016-09-11 17:16:57	Millennial	i didn't watch the other movies
2016-09-11 17:17:00	Urchin	cool
2016-09-11 17:17:02	GGLucas	It's interesting, I'd probably say LoGH is my favorite anime of all time, but at the same time that show has a lot of flaws, way more than my other not-quite-favorites.
2016-09-11 17:17:13	GGLucas	I guess it's a taste thing.
2016-09-11 17:17:37	Urchin	Millennial: Overture to a New War is a good replacement for the first two episodes
2016-09-11 17:17:45	Millennial	well, "best show" doesn't mean "show with no flaws"

2016-09-11 17:17:57	GGLucas	I dunno. Madomagi is essentially flawless.
2016-09-11 17:17:58	Millennial	it just means that the show explored lots of themes that you were interested in, i think
2016-09-11 17:18:14	Millennial	never saw anyone call it madomagi
2016-09-11 17:18:16	Urchin	for example, that guy that dies at the beginning gets a lot of death flags, not just death...
2016-09-11 17:18:45	GGLucas	Millennial: Hm? That's the normal abbreviation though.
2016-09-11 17:18:54	Millennial	GGLucas: i never saw anyone abbreviate it
2016-09-11 17:18:58	GGLucas	I see
2016-09-11 17:19:11	Millennial	i am not sure about that - it's been some time since i watched madoka
2016-09-11 17:19:14	GGLucas	I suppose you're actually making it longer than just saying "madoka".
2016-09-11 17:19:18	Urchin	I can't think of any flaws of LoGH that I'd find really significant
2016-09-11 17:19:36	Millennial	so i can't nitpick every little thing, and i remember i liked it quite a bit overall
2016-09-11 17:19:58	Urchin	interestingly, on my top 3, Madoka comes right after LoGH
2016-09-11 17:20:26	Millennial	i don't think madoka would be in my top 3 though
2016-09-11 17:20:28	GGLucas	Urchin: The terran cultists were horribly contrived. Julian was super bland, I feel they should've actually had him do... well... stuff.. to add some meat to his character art.
2016-09-11 17:20:51	Millennial	GGLucas: i really didn't like julian as a character
2016-09-11 17:21:00	bagelsan	Re:Zero.
2016-09-11 17:21:03	Millennial	but there were other very good characters
2016-09-11 17:21:04	bagelsan	Romanée-Conti, Petelgeuse best girl.
2016-09-11 17:21:09	Millennial	so i just sort of ignored it
2016-09-11 17:21:09	GGLucas	He's just kinda 'there'. He doesn't do much other than be witness to everything.
2016-09-11 17:21:34	GGLucas	Yeah, it's not a huge deal, but it is a fairly large flaw, especially considering his role gets a lot bigger in the final season.
2016-09-11 17:21:44	Millennial	and one thing about lotgh that no other anime really does as well is that it has a massive cast of characters
2016-09-11 17:21:57	Millennial	there's just so many of them
2016-09-11 17:22:09	Urchin	GGLucas: interestingly, I found terran cultists to be not so contrived, given how there were crazy fanatics IRL making news doing horrible things while I was watching the show

2016-09-11 17:23:56	bagelsan	brainwash, right now its a tossup between Petelgeuse and felix as best girl
2016-09-11 17:23:57	Millennial	brainwash: i think it wouldn't be in mine either
2016-09-11 17:24:00	Urchin	I don't mind Julian so much, but then I'm fairly desensitized regarding bland anime protagonists

2016-09-11 17:24:42	Millennial	Urchin: i can't really fault lotgh because julian is bland
2016-09-11 17:25:04	Millennial	it's a flaw, but i think the show more than makes up for it with other characters
2016-09-11 17:25:12	Urchin	btw, in all incarnations put together, LoGH has 660 named characters in total
2016-09-11 17:25:31	Urchin	making it the record holder for anime
2016-09-11 17:25:40	Millennial	ya, i figured it would be the record holder
2016-09-11 17:26:13	GGLucas	I dunno, the thing I like about madoka is that it has an extremely firm grasp of storytelling fundamentals. Which is a weird way to praise something until you realize virtually all anime *sucks* at storytelling.
2016-09-11 17:26:15	Millennial	they also did a good job of giving each character a sufficiently distinct design that you could tell them apart easily by their faces
2016-09-11 17:26:20	Millennial	and that isn't easy to do with 660 characters
2016-09-11 17:26:21	Urchin	I'm not sure if any of the endless shounen even have half that number
2016-09-11 17:26:30	⚡	Millennial looks at A1-Pictures
2016-09-11 17:26:45	Millennial	pretty sure they don't
2016-09-11 17:26:59	Millennial	shonen tend to explore a smaller character cast very deeply, in my experience
2016-09-11 17:27:00	Urchin	(660 character figure is for the entire franchise, not just the main OVA)
2016-09-11 17:27:09	Millennial	ya, i got that
2016-09-11 17:27:24	Millennial	i wonder if i could even name 100 characters from naruto
2016-09-11 17:27:29	GGLucas	Anime writers generally can't tell their ass from their balls when it comes to making a coherent story progression from introduction to buildup to climax.
2016-09-11 17:27:36	Millennial	i suppose i could name 100, but 200 would be pushing it
2016-09-11 17:28:00	Millennial	i am not even sure if there are that many relevant characters
2016-09-11 17:28:21	Millennial	GGLucas: why not :o
2016-09-11 17:28:38	Millennial	it's just that shonen manga are never meant to have that kind of story structure
2016-09-11 17:28:44	Millennial	since they are usually meant to run forever
2016-09-11 17:28:50	Millennial	or as long as they can get good results on the polls
2016-09-11 17:29:18	GGLucas	Nah I'm not even talking about shounen.
2016-09-11 17:29:49	Urchin	the first novel was written in Japan, and it didn't have a plot

2016-09-11 17:31:23	GGLucas	Take Macross Delta. Literally everything else about it is amazing: character design, music, production values, marketing. But kawamori can't tell a story consistently to save his life. The entire show meanders and does nothing for 20+ episodes and then crams the entire "idea of the story" into the final few, because the writer has no clue how to properly convey themes.
2016-09-11 17:31:29	GGLucas	It happens to almost every anime.
2016-09-11 17:31:32	Urchin	dialogue was written in what was essentially a Darmok
2016-09-11 17:32:18	Urchin	um... Macross Delta looked like a horrible idea from the beginning
2016-09-11 17:32:29	GGLucas	An actual competent writer could've pulled it off 100%.
2016-09-11 17:32:44	Urchin	magitek girls fighting terrorism in space, based on the sample of the first episode
2016-09-11 17:32:51	GGLucas	But most anime writers are the type who go "Okay I came up with this great story idea. But what to do in the other 24 epsidose??"
2016-09-11 17:33:30	GGLucas	Another horrible horrible offender: last season's Haifuri. Great great execution, terrible writing dragging down what could've been amazing.
2016-09-11 17:34:03	GGLucas	People didn't learn from garupan at ALL. Nobody seems to get what made that show great. (hint: it wasn't just cute girls + military equipment)

2016-09-11 17:35:35	Millennial	and then dropped
2016-09-11 17:35:56	GGLucas	Girls und Panzer was actually good though, if you can see beyond the (intentionally!) ridiculous premise.
2016-09-11 17:36:04	Millennial	i can't :(
2016-09-11 17:36:07	Urchin	it's also one of the shows on my dropped pile
2016-09-11 17:36:31	Urchin	Sora no Woto was excellent, though
2016-09-11 17:36:45	Millennial	there is only one anime that i've dropped after watching the first 1-2 episodes, came back to later on, watched it and loved it

2016-09-11 17:36:49	GGLucas	In fact I think an interview with one of the creators went "But.. why are they on giant aircraft carrier city ships?" - "We wanted to make sure people understood we were going for a ridiculous premise and it wasn't supposed to be realistic."

2016-09-11 17:38:22	Millennial	and then i dropped both

2016-09-11 17:38:59	Urchin	I didn't even pick up Haifuri, didn't expect it to be good
2016-09-11 17:39:07	GGLucas	Garupan was good because the writers understood how to structure a show. Character introduction -> problem statement -> character development -> tense conflict -> resolution.
2016-09-11 17:39:21	Smeef	unicornjedi: MAYBE
2016-09-11 17:39:35	Millennial	Urchin: i didn't either
2016-09-11 17:39:37	unicornjedi	Smeef: I NEED THE OPPAI
2016-09-11 17:39:41	GGLucas	Haifuri was awful because the writers came up with a gimmick that was only going to last them 1 episode of story, and then figured they needed to come up with 12 other episodes of stuff, instead of expanding their story idea to actual characters and themes.
2016-09-11 17:39:51	Smeef	was that a question or a statement of fact?
2016-09-11 17:39:54	GGLucas	So it ended up with 12 completely pointless filler episodes and then their intended conclusion.
2016-09-11 17:40:00	Millennial	wait
2016-09-11 17:40:05	Millennial	garupan had a story?
2016-09-11 17:40:05	unicornjedi	Smeef: do you have time to draw another dnd character?
2016-09-11 17:40:11	Millennial	uh
2016-09-11 17:40:21	Millennial	i am surprised, i didn't expect it to have one
2016-09-11 17:40:30	GGLucas	Millennial: Yes. Not an amazingly original one, it's a very archetypical "sports club" show.
2016-09-11 17:40:33	GGLucas	But the story was executed well.
2016-09-11 17:40:34	Smeef	unicornjedi, According to my schedule, I can squeeze something in on Tuesday, lol

2016-09-11 17:41:19	Urchin	there are seasons where I watch almost nothing, and there are seasons I watch a bunch of stuff
2016-09-11 17:41:20	Millennial	like, they wasted animator hours on this show
2016-09-11 17:41:28	Millennial	do people actually like this kind of stuff
2016-09-11 17:41:38	Urchin	I can think of worse ideas
2016-09-11 17:41:39	GGLucas	Millennial: What do you mean? Cute girls + military equipment is an established genre, all they needed to do was not fuck up and people would love it.
2016-09-11 17:41:52	Urchin	Unlimited Fafnir comes to mind
2016-09-11 17:41:53	Millennial	GGLucas: ya, i don't get how cute girls + military equipment is an established genre
2016-09-11 17:41:58	Millennial	i know that it is and i still don't get it
2016-09-11 17:42:20	Urchin	Millennial: Sora no Woto started it, I think
2016-09-11 17:42:22	GGLucas	Because we like military tactics and we like cute girls, so porque no los dos?
2016-09-11 17:42:35	Millennial	GGLucas: i like salt and i like strawberries
2016-09-11 17:42:44	Millennial	but i find that they don't mix very well
2016-09-11 17:42:46	Urchin	btw, Sora no Woto is my #1 show
2016-09-11 17:42:51	GGLucas	Strike Witches was way before that I think.
2016-09-11 17:42:55	GGLucas	Not sure if it was the first.
2016-09-11 17:42:59	GGLucas	But it was definitely one of.
2016-09-11 17:43:24	GGLucas	And then the extreme popularity of KanColle made everyone jump on the genre.
2016-09-11 17:43:34	Millennial	but there's a problem that i don't like cute girls a lot in general
2016-09-11 17:43:38	Millennial	so perhaps i'm just fucked in the head

2016-09-11 17:46:17	Urchin	there was the one about assault rifles as well

2016-09-11 17:47:42	Millennial	but well
2016-09-11 17:47:46	Urchin	have you seen the Shirobako OVAs?

2016-09-11 17:48:36	GGLucas	In any case, for all of Urobuchi's flaws his biggest strength IMO is his very good understanding of story structure and pacing, and madomagi being his second best work is of course exemplary in those aspects.

2016-09-11 17:49:43	GGLucas	F/Z is kind of a shame because nasu and urobuchi don't complement eachother very well at all.
2016-09-11 17:49:54	GGLucas	Both of their flaws kind of worsen each others'.
2016-09-11 17:49:59	Millennial	really?
2016-09-11 17:50:09	Millennial	i felt it was the other way around
2016-09-11 17:50:25	Adyrhan	Hi
2016-09-11 17:50:35	Urchin	I don't think Fate/Zero was bad
2016-09-11 17:50:42	Urchin	not perfect, but far from bad
2016-09-11 17:50:49	GGLucas	I mean urobuchi is definitely a much better writer than nasu is so F/Z is still the second best Fate/ thing, but their chuuni tendencies kind of amplify each other.
2016-09-11 17:51:01	Millennial	idk, i liked fate/zero more than i liked madoka
2016-09-11 17:51:16	Millennial	GGLucas: i'm ok with chuuni tendencies
2016-09-11 17:51:23	Millennial	perhaps that's why i like it
2016-09-11 17:51:23	Millennial	lol
2016-09-11 17:51:49	Millennial	also, how can you watch anything type moon and not have that feeling
2016-09-11 17:52:04	Millennial	it's worse in some of nasu's works than others, but it's always there

2016-09-11 17:52:16	GGLucas	Sure.
2016-09-11 17:52:38	GGLucas	Nasu is as close to the inventor of chuuni writing played straight as you can get.
2016-09-11 17:52:46	Millennial	definitely
2016-09-11 17:52:51	Urchin	I don't know. I've only played the Fate rout of the VN, watched F/Z and the old FSN show
2016-09-11 17:53:00	Millennial	Urchin: no kara no kyoukai?
2016-09-11 17:53:04	Millennial	you should watch those
2016-09-11 17:53:07	Urchin	no
2016-09-11 17:53:26	GGLucas	KnK is worth watching just for the ufotable art porn.
2016-09-11 17:53:29	Millennial	^
2016-09-11 17:53:44	Millennial	but i am a big sucker for nasu's chuuni writing
2016-09-11 17:53:49	Millennial	so i loved it regardless
2016-09-11 17:53:49	Urchin	Millennial: nope
2016-09-11 17:54:16	Millennial	by "nope" you mean "no, it isn't worth it"...?
2016-09-11 17:54:17	Adyrhan	I'm wondering, since when are "Millenials" a thing? I thought those were called Generation Y
2016-09-11 17:54:28	Millennial	Adyrhan: "Millennial" is a sith lord from star wars
2016-09-11 17:54:28	Urchin	the big problem I have with FSN is that Saber reminds me of an ex too much
2016-09-11 17:54:34	Millennial	has nothing to do with any other use of the term
2016-09-11 17:54:49	Millennial	Urchin: LOL
2016-09-11 17:54:56	Adyrhan	Millennial: your name inspired my question, but I'm not refering to your name
2016-09-11 17:54:58	Urchin	it could also mean someone who believes the end is nigh
2016-09-11 17:55:00	Millennial	my biggest problem with FSN is shirou
2016-09-11 17:55:08	GGLucas	Indeed
2016-09-11 17:55:17	vash	millenials is a term millenials made up for their imaginary persecutors to have something to call them when they say they're lazy
2016-09-11 17:55:27	GGLucas	Which is why Kaleid Liner is objectively the best Fate/, since Shirou or his emo dad aren't the protagonist.
2016-09-11 17:55:30	Millennial	the art porn is even better in ufotable's UBW adaptation than in, say, KnK
2016-09-11 17:55:37	Millennial	but shirou just fucks the experience up for me
2016-09-11 17:55:42	Millennial	and his whole subplot with archer
2016-09-11 17:55:52	⚡	Urchin shrugs
2016-09-11 17:55:56	vash	this discussion is kind of hilarious to read in on
2016-09-11 17:55:57	Millennial	"Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right" and that sort of thing
2016-09-11 17:56:06	vash	debating the merits of cartoon plot authors
2016-09-11 17:56:26	Adyrhan	vash: you sure? I don't know of any of my "millenials" knowing they are that lol
2016-09-11 17:56:27	Millennial	GGLucas: haha
2016-09-11 17:56:31	Millennial	GGLucas: i liked kiritsugu :(
2016-09-11 17:56:35	vash	Adyrhan: what
2016-09-11 17:56:41	GGLucas	Yeah! How dare we demand excellence from our chinese cartoons!
2016-09-11 17:56:49	Adyrhan	vash: millenials
2016-09-11 17:57:05	Millennial	but i can totally see someone not liking F/Z because of kiritsugu
2016-09-11 17:57:14	vash	Adyrhan: i just always read shit on facebook from them saying "where are all these lazy millenials you always talk about"
2016-09-11 17:57:18	vash	and no one talks about that
2016-09-11 17:57:22	GGLucas	He was just unnecessarily emo for a guy of his life experience.
2016-09-11 17:57:27	vash	just millenials acting persecuted
2016-09-11 17:57:36	Millennial	GGLucas: yes - but that's how it is in anime usually
2016-09-11 17:57:41	Millennial	stuff is exaggerated
2016-09-11 17:57:43	Adyrhan	vash: so you say it is a facebook thing hmm, that could make sense. I don't use FB lol

2016-09-11 17:57:53	Millennial	and when you have nasu + urobuchi working together, you're really in for something like this
2016-09-11 17:57:55	vash	it's where i see it the most
2016-09-11 17:58:01	Urchin	btw, I'm reminded of the most improbable thing in Arslan Senki, when the Lusitanian king is stabbed, the guard just opens the doors inward while the king is leaning on them, that's just more incredible than anything else on that show
2016-09-11 17:58:13	Millennial	Urchin: that was fucking hilarious
2016-09-11 17:58:21	vash	but reddit, imgur, all that shit

2016-09-11 18:01:18	Millennial	GGLucas: i read some article written by someone where he explained at length how anime characters were usually incarnations of certain ideals, and those ideals basically dictated their actions all the way through
2016-09-11 18:01:30	Millennial	which is not true for every anime, obviously
2016-09-11 18:01:49	Millennial	but i found that it is not so far off the mark when it comes to something like fate/zero
2016-09-11 18:01:57	Millennial	because that's exactly what the entire show is about
2016-09-11 18:02:15	GGLucas	Hmm. That just seems like a nice way of saying "your characters are one-dimensional"
2016-09-11 18:02:51	Millennial	they are, sort of

2016-09-11 18:05:00	Millennial	i wouldn't say there is a direct connection between this and being one dimensional, although when it is done wrong it could certainly end up that way
2016-09-11 18:05:27	GGLucas	Well FSN is a special case because a lot of the story is directly about idealism.
2016-09-11 18:05:34	Millennial	so is fate/zero
2016-09-11 18:05:44	Millennial	it's not about "idealism", per se
2016-09-11 18:05:47	Millennial	but it's about ideas
2016-09-11 18:05:48	GGLucas	It's just that nasu's writing is so convoluted the themes are barely brought across at all.
2016-09-11 18:05:59	GGLucas	So most people just enjoy it for the worldbuilding.
2016-09-11 18:06:04	Millennial	usually, yes
2016-09-11 18:06:15	Millennial	i would rather not have nasu handle these themes in his stories, tbh
2016-09-11 18:06:21	Millennial	because he can't do it very well
2016-09-11 18:06:41	Millennial	it usually ends up being some sort of meaningless sophistry about things nobody cared about and nobody ever will
2016-09-11 18:06:55	Millennial	and i sit down and think to myself how much thinking nasu actually did about these ideas
2016-09-11 18:07:02	Millennial	and how drunk he was when he did said thinking
2016-09-11 18:07:14	GGLucas	KnK especially is a great example of someone just writing whatever they think would be cool

2016-09-11 18:08:09	Millennial	and i was foolish enough to think that i could follow along
2016-09-11 18:08:14	Millennial	but it was nasuverse logic
2016-09-11 18:08:22	Avonis	let me guess
2016-09-11 18:08:28	Avonis	it's Kara no Kyoukai 
2016-09-11 18:08:30	Avonis	good stuff
2016-09-11 18:08:30	Millennial	yes
2016-09-11 18:09:11	GGLucas	Nasu's conversations should be treated as star trek technobabble.
2016-09-11 18:09:15	Millennial	i think nasu goes on this website for ideas about his work: http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/

2016-09-11 18:11:08	Millennial	ya, that one is more accurate :P
2016-09-11 18:11:15	Millennial	it's similar ofc
2016-09-11 18:11:33	Millennial	and what really astounds and baffles me is how much praise these movies get for being profound and deep
2016-09-11 18:11:41	Millennial	especially the fifth movie, iirc
2016-09-11 18:11:52	GGLucas	Not really astounding.
2016-09-11 18:11:59	Millennial	i suppose you just have to sound cool
2016-09-11 18:12:03	GGLucas	Just people trying to believe *they're* deep
2016-09-11 18:12:26	Avonis	I like them because they are dark not deep

2016-09-11 18:12:34	GGLucas	I like them because they're pretty.

2016-09-11 18:13:15	GGLucas	Also anything that has noto mamiko going psycho is a good watch in my book.
2016-09-11 18:13:30	theholyduck	like. when their sexual organs interlock like mollusks

2016-09-11 18:17:43	Millennial	kajiura does reuse melodies, but she usually changes them sufficiently so they are still fresh
2016-09-11 18:17:44	Avonis	ahh Kajiura ?
2016-09-11 18:17:51	Millennial	usually
2016-09-11 18:18:05	Millennial	she has some soundtracks where she uses the same melody over and over, sand dream comes to mind
2016-09-11 18:18:10	Avonis	let's which ones sounded the same to me
2016-09-11 18:18:24	Millennial	but then again
2016-09-11 18:18:25	theholyduck	well in a given series
2016-09-11 18:18:27	Millennial	people love bolero
2016-09-11 18:18:27	theholyduck	yes they reuse themes
2016-09-11 18:18:30	theholyduck	but between series
2016-09-11 18:18:32	theholyduck	not so much
2016-09-11 18:18:34	Millennial	and bolero is the same melody repeated over and over
2016-09-11 18:18:34	Millennial	so
2016-09-11 18:18:51	theholyduck	but like reusing and repeating the same musical themes is important in stories
2016-09-11 18:18:53	GGLucas	theholyduck: I think you need to distinguish between kajiura's OSTs and kalafina's OP/ED themes.
2016-09-11 18:18:58	Avonis	ahh Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai
2016-09-11 18:19:05	GGLucas	theholyduck: Because the last few kalafina OPs have sounded boringly identical.
2016-09-11 18:19:08	Avonis	they have some similarities

2016-09-11 18:20:22	Millennial	ya
2016-09-11 18:20:24	GGLucas	Yes, and Aldnoah, F/Z and UBW's kalafina songs sound so similar I often can't tell which one was which.
2016-09-11 18:20:32	Avonis	see
2016-09-11 18:20:35	Millennial	GGLucas: they do?
2016-09-11 18:20:41	Millennial	i think they sound worlds apart
2016-09-11 18:20:45	Avonis	I can't be the only one who noticed that
2016-09-11 18:20:54	theholyduck	Avonis: none of those shows are kaijura
2016-09-11 18:20:55	theholyduck	though
2016-09-11 18:21:00	Millennial	Avonis: F/Z is
2016-09-11 18:21:00	theholyduck	so i dunno why you are bringing them up
2016-09-11 18:21:03	Millennial	and the others aren't
2016-09-11 18:21:04	Avonis	F/Z isn't Kajiura ?
2016-09-11 18:21:09	theholyduck	f/z is
2016-09-11 18:21:14	Millennial	aldnoah is hiroyuki sawano and UBW is kenji kawai
2016-09-11 18:21:15	Millennial	iirc
2016-09-11 18:21:19	theholyduck	but titan, gundam unicorn
2016-09-11 18:21:20	theholyduck	etc
2016-09-11 18:21:21	Millennial	i might be wrong about UBW
2016-09-11 18:21:21	theholyduck	isnt.
2016-09-11 18:21:26	GGLucas	But yeah that's why I said, you gotta distinguish between the OSTs and Kalafina as a band.
2016-09-11 18:21:32	Millennial	oh, wait
2016-09-11 18:21:34	Millennial	the ending themes
2016-09-11 18:21:36	Avonis	 titan, gundam unicorn, snk -> Sawano
2016-09-11 18:21:37	theholyduck	ubw isnt either.
2016-09-11 18:21:38	Millennial	yes, those are similar
2016-09-11 18:21:45	Avonis	and you know it's Sawano when you hear it lol
2016-09-11 18:21:45	theholyduck	well kalfina != kaijura
2016-09-11 18:21:52	theholyduck	kaijura is a ost composer
2016-09-11 18:21:58	Millennial	Avonis: of course
2016-09-11 18:21:59	theholyduck	kalfina is a vocal group that shes involved with
2016-09-11 18:22:06	GGLucas	Sure.
2016-09-11 18:22:08	Avonis	theholyduck, I know
2016-09-11 18:22:13	Millennial	GGLucas: how about umineko's opening
2016-09-11 18:22:13	theholyduck	when you say kaijura you mean the composer
2016-09-11 18:22:14	Avonis	created for Kara no Kyoukai project
2016-09-11 18:22:15	Millennial	do you like that one
2016-09-11 18:22:16	theholyduck	when you say kalfina 
2016-09-11 18:22:17	theholyduck	you mean the band
2016-09-11 18:22:28	Avonis	they work together really
2016-09-11 18:22:31	theholyduck	why do you guys keep switching

2016-09-11 18:23:15	Avonis	Millennial, oh he has

2016-09-11 18:23:21	GGLucas	Millennial: Not sure why you brought that up. It's okay
2016-09-11 18:23:29	theholyduck	Avonis: meh. kaijura has a whole career before kalfina
2016-09-11 18:23:29	Millennial	Avonis: idk, listen to omoi haruka and unmei no yoru
2016-09-11 18:23:34	Avonis	vaporwave like stuff, espcially the old ones
2016-09-11 18:23:41	GGLucas	I'm not a huge fan of the high pitched vocals on umineko's OP.
2016-09-11 18:23:44	Millennial	GGLucas: no reason
2016-09-11 18:23:47	GGLucas	But otherwise it's fine.
2016-09-11 18:23:53	Millennial	GGLucas: noo :( that's the entire appeal of akiko shikata
2016-09-11 18:23:57	Millennial	well
2016-09-11 18:24:04	theholyduck	Avonis: like. kaijura made osts for like 11 years
2016-09-11 18:24:09	theholyduck	before kalfina was invented
2016-09-11 18:24:20	Avonis	Millennial, that's obviously Kawai, he uses synths a lot :p
2016-09-11 18:24:21	theholyduck	and kalfina does ops for shows kaijura doesnt do the osts for
2016-09-11 18:24:26	Millennial	Avonis: unmei no yoru is
2016-09-11 18:24:30	Millennial	omoi haruka isn't
2016-09-11 18:25:02	Millennial	but perhaps this is just kenji kawai being flexible
2016-09-11 18:25:06	Millennial	and i should think of it that way
2016-09-11 18:25:10	Avonis	maybe
2016-09-11 18:25:18	Avonis	but he's smart with synths I like his stuff
2016-09-11 18:25:25	Avonis	especially the old Patlabor stuff
2016-09-11 18:25:39	theholyduck	so yeah. to say it again. when speaking of the band say kalfina. when speaking of the composer say kaijura. whenever you equate 1 with the other. stupidity arises
2016-09-11 18:25:41	GGLucas	theholyduck: Eh, I think it's okay to acknowledge the link between the two, since they share a composer and a "sound".
2016-09-11 18:25:48	theholyduck	GGLucas: they dont really though
2016-09-11 18:25:48	GGLucas	Even though they are distinct things.
2016-09-11 18:25:50	Avonis	and the epic GitS soundtrack

2016-09-12 20:39:42	pteague	hmm... does your phone allow that? i.e. can your laptop or something use it? i know telephone companies here in the states disabled or charge extra for that if it's not the phone itself
2016-09-12 20:39:45	unicornjedi	pteague: that anime was okay
2016-09-12 20:40:05	ko-san	pteague: Yeah, that's what I'm using right now... Using pdanet to avoid needing to pay extra for it.
2016-09-12 20:41:04	pteague	ko-san, what are the vm's on? the box that's using the wifi directly?
2016-09-12 20:42:12	ko-san	pteague: I'm running a Windows host, using Hyper-V for VM's. Honestly, I know it ultimately needs a static IP to work, because I'm pretty sure that the problem is that pdanet doesn't provide any DHCP, but I tried to mimic the network configuration that my main box has, and it still didn't work.
2016-09-12 20:42:50	pteague	ko-san, you using virtualbox, vmware, or something else?
2016-09-12 20:43:07	ko-san	pteague: I'm using Microsofts HyperViser...
2016-09-12 20:43:20	ko-san	HyperVisor? I can never remember the spelling.

2016-09-12 20:43:55	kirx	 Hello people
2016-09-12 20:43:59	pteague	i've never used that ... does it have a way to set what the vm's networking is set to? i believe it needs to be set as bridged
2016-09-12 20:44:09	kirx	What's up?
2016-09-12 20:44:13	Nanobot	I've managed to lose an INSIGNIFICANT amount of weight! I should celebrate with a pizza made out of cookie.
2016-09-12 20:44:33	ko-san	Yes, that's mostly handled via virtual switch management pteague , and I've had it working flawlessly until I had to use pdanet as opposed to my physical nic.
2016-09-12 20:44:43	kirx	Is there a gluten pizza in the restaurants?
2016-09-12 20:44:50	kirx	Im gluten allergic :/
2016-09-12 20:44:59	kirx	Proven :/
2016-09-12 20:45:00	Nanobot	How come losing weight at 29 is so much harder than losing weight at 24?
2016-09-12 20:45:07	pyon	Nanobot: How much is that insignificant amount of weight?
2016-09-12 20:45:08	ko-san	pteague: But again, I'm almost certain that it's because of a lack of routing on the switch, and I can't seem to get any static setups to be happy with pdanets network configuration.
2016-09-12 20:45:21	pyon	Nanobot: 1lb?
2016-09-12 20:45:30	Nanobot	pyon: 4 pounds. Not even the "free" water weight you're supposed to lose in a week

2016-09-12 20:58:32	Nanobot	This is 2016, and a decently-sized pizza chain is STILL treating their ordering website like a second-class citizen. Of the 12 items listed on the first page, only one has a photo. The mozzarella sticks.

2016-09-12 21:00:52	bagelsan	Nanobot, call them up and ask them to explain each pizza

2016-09-12 21:01:14	Nanobot	Imagine going into a Denny's, and they hand you a menu, and there are NO photos, and everything is called "The Gyronacker" and "The Merton" with no descriptions
2016-09-12 21:02:21	Nanobot	And there's something called "the cheeseburger pizza"
2016-09-12 21:03:16	bagelsan	Nanobot, theres a burrito place that has a "joey bag of chips"
2016-09-12 21:03:32	bagelsan	its a burrito and tortilla chips.
2016-09-12 21:03:49	Nanobot	Also, everything is listed with a "starting at" price. A pizza "starting at $4.95". No. Nobody is buying a $4.95 pizza. Nobody.

2016-09-12 21:11:08	Nanobot	Sasazuka: Nothing
2016-09-12 21:11:13	Nanobot	Literally nothing

2016-09-12 21:11:38	Nanobot	Once you start adding pizza to your pizza, it becomes higher than $4.95
2016-09-12 21:11:38	Sasazuka	wait so you pay 4.95 for nothing assuming that's what you ordered?
2016-09-12 21:12:01	Nanobot	You might technically get a "mini size" piece of baked dough

2016-09-17 17:18:09	SailorHaumea	All I have to say is: Anyone who tries to mock religion by suggesting The Flying Spaghetti Monster be acknowledged in religious references is a fucking asshole? No one likes someone who makes fun of others' beliefs.?

2016-09-17 18:13:58	BillyZane	so right now my car is being diagnosed at a toyota dealership and if they find anything wrong with it, they will fix it for free!
2016-09-17 18:14:07	BillyZane	meaning i'm going to get a brand new battery for it
2016-09-17 18:14:35	nick5	which brand is the battery going to be?

2016-09-17 18:16:05	nick5	what will they do then?
2016-09-17 18:16:34	BillyZane	no there's something wrong. i went to the dealer ship before for a recall and the idiot fuck face at the front desk told me "your battery needs replacement. that will be $4400 please." didn't even tell me it was covered by the warranty. 
2016-09-17 18:16:46	BillyZane	it should be a brand new battery or at the very least a refurbished one

2016-09-17 18:27:00	BillyZane	elios, alternatively, you can open the battery, test the modules thuroughly, which involves charging and discharge cycles, and then replace whatever module is bad, this could cost as little ast $30 for 1 bad module

2016-09-17 19:07:00	koan	perky is not accurate
2016-09-17 19:07:01	nick5	hexec what do you mean by genius?
2016-09-17 19:07:30	nerdshark	koan: i'm translating pixiv tags here, not literature
2016-09-17 19:07:32	nerdshark	it'll be fine
2016-09-17 19:07:33	hexec	in some way intellegent
2016-09-17 19:07:36	nerdshark	it'll get the point across
2016-09-17 19:07:49	hexec	like death note, code geass
2016-09-17 19:07:49	koan	nerdshark: no it won't, it's inaccurate for that
2016-09-17 19:07:55	koan	perky is not that style of tit
2016-09-17 19:08:14	nerdshark	by all means, please correct me master
2016-09-17 19:08:22	hexec	also i love joining ircs and be in the middle of a random chat
2016-09-17 19:08:35	hexec	about breasts now
2016-09-17 19:08:43	nick5	hexec intelligent in what way? like the stereotypical asocial silent type?
2016-09-17 19:09:09	koan	nerdshark: perky is the nipples point more up
2016-09-17 19:09:17	nerdshark	i just want to translate these fucking pixiv tabs ;_;
2016-09-17 19:09:38	nerdshark	koan: if you look at the pixiv link i posted earlier, there were definitely some perky tits tagged with '釣鐘型'
2016-09-17 19:09:43	koan	i would say more... pendulous
2016-09-17 19:09:44	hexec	outsmarting opponets, surprising. Like light in death note or L and N or the siblings in no game no life nick5
2016-09-17 19:09:45	nerdshark	the first example, as a matter of fact
2016-09-17 19:09:52	koan	pendulous tits, yes

2016-09-17 19:10:00	nerdshark	you're a pendulous tit
2016-09-17 19:10:23	nerdshark	so i WAS right
2016-09-17 19:10:30	nerdshark	my initial thought was droopy or saggy
2016-09-17 19:10:31	koan	nah
2016-09-17 19:10:35	nerdshark	i shouldn't second-guess myself
2016-09-17 19:10:38	koan	oh, yea, that was right
2016-09-17 19:10:46	koan	but saggy is not bell shaped
2016-09-17 19:10:55	koan	saggy are granny or africa tits
2016-09-17 19:10:58	nerdshark	but saggy is a synonym of pendulous

2016-09-18 01:36:53	Myrl-saki	hmmm
2016-09-18 01:37:16	Myrl-saki	dunno considering the new president.
2016-09-18 01:37:28	Myrl-saki	but philippine government is pretty corrupt
2016-09-18 01:37:32	warsh	trump?
2016-09-18 01:37:50	Myrl-saki	it's like trump, but less walls, less deporting and more killing.
2016-09-18 01:37:51	luke-jr	Myrl-saki: it's really the corruption that annoys me :p
2016-09-18 01:38:16	Myrl-saki	i mean
2016-09-18 01:38:17	luke-jr	basically by "above the law" I really am aiming for "above being the victim of corruption"
2016-09-18 01:38:48	Myrl-saki	our president promised "to destroy corruption" but all he's talking about now is killing drug dealers

2016-09-18 01:39:42	Myrl-saki	yes
2016-09-18 01:39:47	Myrl-saki	3000 killed in like a month
2016-09-18 01:39:53	Myrl-saki	try to up that.

2016-09-18 01:43:06	crutchy	capital punishment is just legal murder
2016-09-18 01:43:24	exiff	crutchy: It's passive though. Things like pharmaceuticals effectively getting the nation doped up on opioids.

2016-09-18 01:48:46	koan	and the lie that fat is evil broke that balance
2016-09-18 01:49:36	Smeef	Generally speaking, it's about diet, but genetics can go a long way as well, I mean, I sit in a chair most of the day eating just the worst garbage, and I'm still inexplicably fit.
2016-09-18 01:49:38	random_numbers	A certain quantity of fat is required for metabolic functions. Of course, gut fat like many have is absolutely unnecessary and unhealty.

2016-09-18 01:50:53	Smeef	In America it's "fat", in some parts of Africa it's "famine resistant"

2016-09-18 01:51:04	crutchy	in america is laziness
2016-09-18 01:51:07	koan	the problem is actually doing it

2016-09-18 01:52:52	crutchy	i think for active people though fat and sugars are just sources of energy

2016-09-18 02:22:18	crutchy	like when you visit the control center of a power station. all the screens and buttons look really cool... but after a few months of shiftwork they start getting old
2016-09-18 02:22:39	random_numbers	Nah that's the thing. What was new yesterday is already obsolete tomorrow. That's what the singularity means.
2016-09-18 02:22:58	crutchy	hmm. i dunno anything about singularities
2016-09-18 02:23:24	random_numbers	Look at an exponential curve. That's an example if you assume it represents technological progress.
2016-09-18 02:23:27	crutchy	is that like one of those climate-change-isms?
2016-09-18 02:23:59	random_numbers	A singularity is a point at which the normal rules to define a system start to break down.

2016-09-18 02:25:15	Smeef	Not necessarily, I mean assuming there's a place for human intelligence, or a reason to preserve natural consciousness, imagine being able to imagine yourself expanding your own imagination and having it happen naturally, like unlimited neuroplasticity.
2016-09-18 02:25:23	random_numbers	The way matter interacts with those is unique to those conditions.
2016-09-18 02:26:29	crutchy	hmm. ok that's all a bit too abstract for me, but you're probably right. i dunno if those sorts of things would be something that we could consciously experience as a singularity or not but i guess its interesting to think about
2016-09-18 02:27:28	Smeef	Don't like the laws of the universe? Fuck it, make your own one, it's no less real than the one we started in, right? Tweak the fundamental constants at the bing back so that all matter and energy eventually coalesces into a universe where your favorite anime is real!

2016-09-18 02:27:56	random_numbers	Someone uninterested in theory would be unable to see it at first. Setting up physical infrastructure is slow. Building hundreds of different processor designs inside an hour, each better than the last? Very noticeable as far as theory goes.
2016-09-18 02:30:02	Smeef	Not just processing either, but networking, to the point where every brain is just a neuron in a vast superbrain. Like the LCL in Evangelion, just an ocean of interlinked consciousness communicating so much data, they might as well be a single organism.

2016-09-18 02:34:55	Smeef	I have this horrible thought that keeps me up at night. Before the singularity happens, and we're at a point where we can simulate human beings virtually, what's to stop people from simulating other people like in a virtual machine, just free open source virtual people, having their minds torn apart in someone's basement somewhere for secret unethical medical research or something.
2016-09-18 02:35:13	random_numbers	That's obvious.
2016-09-18 02:35:34	random_numbers	Now think of what happens to forks of yourself transmitted anywhere at some point, when the encryption gets broken.

2016-09-18 03:13:16	SailorHaumea	Gen IV was best gen
2016-09-18 03:13:24	TsundereNoises	was Gen IV 10 years ago
2016-09-18 03:13:29	TsundereNoises	how many are there?
2016-09-18 03:13:30	SailorHaumea	Yes
2016-09-18 03:13:50	SailorHaumea	7 starts November 18 with Sun and Moon
2016-09-18 03:14:02	TsundereNoises	Okay, at least it's not as many as I was worried about
2016-09-18 03:14:45	TsundereNoises	Sorry to be serious for a minute, but I didn't think I was doing anything to be a dick, was just kidding around
2016-09-18 03:14:49	GGLucas	That's only because they created 2 games in one generation once, and the remakes aren't counting.
2016-09-18 03:15:27	TsundereNoises	Well remakes probably shouldn't count, right?  If they don't have any pokemon more newfangled than existing ones
2016-09-18 03:15:27	SailorHaumea	721 Pokémon as of Gen 6, plus 42 confirmed new Pokémon so far to be added in Gen 7
2016-09-18 03:15:35	SailorHaumea	So 763 and counting
2016-09-18 03:15:50	SailorHaumea	Remakes sometimes add to the original
2016-09-18 03:16:12	SailorHaumea	Like ORAS has a new Hoopa forme. XY only has the first forme.
2016-09-18 03:16:15	TsundereNoises	Some of the remakes have original pokemon?  Or just they put new ones from new games into old games?
2016-09-18 03:16:31	GGLucas	TsundereNoises: Probably not, just saying there've been way more pokemon games in that timespan than the 2 generation that have passed.
2016-09-18 03:16:59	SailorHaumea	Basically, ORAS is RS with features added since Gen 3.
2016-09-18 03:17:00	TsundereNoises	Last pokemon game I completed was Gold
2016-09-18 03:17:00	+ljrbot	Genesis 3:-1* -- The serpent's craft. The fall of our first parents. Their punishment. The promise of a Redeemer.
2016-09-18 03:17:17	SailorHaumea	Instead of only 386 Pokémon, there's 721.
2016-09-18 03:17:24	TsundereNoises	I tried Ruby for a bit in an emulator and then got distracted 1/3 of the way through
2016-09-18 03:17:29	SailorHaumea	And vastly improved graphics, ofc.
2016-09-18 03:17:38	SailorHaumea	You should play OR or AS
2016-09-18 03:17:48	TsundereNoises	what are those?
2016-09-18 03:18:00	SailorHaumea	Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
2016-09-18 03:18:01	TsundereNoises	and what device should they be played on
2016-09-18 03:18:05	SailorHaumea	3DS
2016-09-18 03:18:34	GGLucas	It's a bit hard to play pokemon nowadays because they're so damn easy none of the gameplay design means anything.
2016-09-18 03:18:48	SailorHaumea	Remakes of Ruby and Sapphire, but 10 times better
2016-09-18 03:19:06	TsundereNoises	GGLucas: When I used to replay red/blue/gold/silver a bunch I liked to give myself artificial restrictions, like only bug pokemon
2016-09-18 03:19:18	TsundereNoises	sadly not enough characters to name yourself bugcatcher something
2016-09-18 03:19:34	SailorHaumea	You should play FireRed/LeafGreen and HeartGold/SoulSilver too.
2016-09-18 03:19:37	GGLucas	TsundereNoises: Yeah, that could work.
2016-09-18 03:20:08	TsundereNoises	Type restrictions are kind of fun, as long as it's possible to do it without just crazy overleveling
2016-09-18 03:20:13	TsundereNoises	or they used to be
2016-09-18 03:21:01	GGLucas	I mean it's a bit asinine complaining about a kids game's difficulty.
