2016-06-25 17:17:13	mugen	They all kind of look like flashy gimmick sites though, not realy a fan of any 
2016-06-25 17:17:17	mugen	they just have too much going on
2016-06-25 17:19:24	insidious	Yeah, he wants something gimicky like that. Whichever theme I use i'm definitely going to tone it down and make it less chaotic though

2016-06-25 18:07:04	mugen	I feel that, is he actually setting up an online party store? Is this some kind of money laundering scheme on his part lol 
2016-06-25 18:07:47	mugen	Or is it just going to be a site for an existing store / wholesale party supplies

2016-07-06 21:09:07	Killpot	dank
2016-07-06 21:10:23	Killpot	I'm thinking that every time a process starts, it will suspend it immediately, and then communicate with the client, and the client will pop up a message box, and whatever your answer is y/n it will then ask always or just this once
2016-07-06 21:10:42	Killpot	and if it's always, it will add it to a pre-aproved list, so when it get's queried it will auto respond
2016-07-06 21:10:57	Killpot	or vice-versa and auto-deny
2016-07-06 21:48:45	Axari	you know how people say they have hoes in different area codes

2016-07-06 22:16:12	Killpot	how do you think i should design this form?
2016-07-06 22:16:37	Killpot	I'm thinking two list views, one on top, one on bottom
2016-07-06 22:16:42	Killpot	top is for approved processes
2016-07-06 22:16:49	Killpot	bottom is for denied processes
2016-07-06 22:17:05	Killpot	right click context menu to manually add or delete
2016-07-06 22:23:12	Killpot	and when an uknown process starts, it's suspended and a messagebox pops up asking for the user's decision, yes or no, then just this once or always, and if always add it to the list
2016-07-06 22:23:16	Killpot	sounds gucci?
