2016-07-04 12:38:06	grimel	Hi, all. Probably my question has been discussed a lot but anyway. What parsing library do you use the most? After being stuck with only requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy and some Selenium I decided investigate for more libraries and quick look gave me that there are such libraries as Grab, Mechanize, Robobrowser, PyQuery, PyCurl, Dryscrape, Pyparsing, Ghost.py and many many others. Which one is worth trying and wasting time on it?)

2016-07-04 14:18:52	dunpeal	i.e. it saves you the effort of writing your own installation client.
2016-07-04 14:18:54	offby1	dunpeal: fair enough.  Never done that though

2016-07-04 14:19:31	Lartza	So then I don't see what is the problem
2016-07-04 14:19:34	foo	I have a postgres database, with sqlalchemy ORM. I have a column that's text data type, and in this column, sometimes I store text, and sometimes I store an int. If I store an int, and fetch the result, it comes back as a string. I was thinking of using yaml.safe_dump() and safe_load() to store the value and pull it back, so that if I do this, it will preserve the data type when getting back into python. Does this sound sloppy? Or does this sound ...
2016-07-04 14:19:36	Lartza	Why can't it work like IRC?
2016-07-04 14:19:40	foo	... acceptable to a more experienced dev?

However, that's less relevant these days; lots of software can be "delivered" as a web site

2016-07-04 15:52:11	archer121_	Hey, I need your advice on which data structure to use. Here is my code. https://bpaste.net/show/70ebe57c2944
2016-07-04 15:52:17	archer121_	So if the program goes not know how to resolve a conflict (ie the same book already exists in a different category), it asks the user what to do, and then stores it as a rule for future use.
2016-07-04 15:52:21	archer121_	How do I store the rule? What is  the best datastructure to use?
2016-07-04 15:52:26	archer121_	Example of a rule is: if a book is of english/fiction and it reappears as english/poem, keep it as english/poem

2016-07-04 17:26:18	LyndsySimon	Otherwise, my leading contender is to rewrite citeproc.py from the ground up. I've used it and it's very difficult to use - and the code seems to be a line-for-line translation of citeproc.js.

2016-07-04 19:17:00	cmtptr	Anic87, general rule of thumb: tcp is reliable, but stream-based (it provides you no delineation between messages); alterntely, udp is message based (sendto()s-to-recvfrom()s are 1:1), but there's no guarantee that they'll arrive in the right order, or at all
2016-07-04 19:17:42	Anic87	I need to use tcp for this
2016-07-04 19:18:06	Anic87	I'll just have to send the buffer size first

2016-07-04 19:18:55	Anic87	It's a file
2016-07-04 19:19:19	cmtptr	then I would send a size, and then recv() in blocks of 4096 or so and write them to disk as they arrive
2016-07-04 19:19:24	offby1	Humbert: I haven't looked at your particular problem, but my attitude is: always use the dumb, brute-force solution, if it works

2016-07-04 23:15:46	Vornicus	the reason is that in python, methods are just functions; the object a method is called upon is passed as the first argument.
2016-07-04 23:16:14	Vornicus	Lua does the same thing, though it's got some syntactic sugar to make the self implicit in the signature.

Because I'm not sure when the input will end, have to check for 'StopIteration' all over the place. Is there a way to write the exception handler once and make it break out of all the nexted loops and functions whenever it sees the exception.

2016-07-05 17:23:52	Vady	and why is relation tables better than what I'm doing
2016-07-05 17:23:54	jwhisnant	hherman1: you might want pyside instead of tk.
2016-07-05 17:24:13	bjs	Vady: the simplistic answer is "because that's what it was designed for"
2016-07-05 17:24:15	hherman1	jwhisnant, it will be rather simple, items will be added to a list, each item will be updated several (finite) times, and there may also be a "folder select" button which should open the OS folder selection menu
2016-07-05 17:24:35	hherman1	jwhisnant, when I say the items are going to be updated i mean theyll have some indicator of "status" which is updated

2016-07-05 17:24:52	hherman1	jwhisnant, there could be many or few items so they need to be presented in a scrollable list
2016-07-05 17:24:55	bjs	Vady: the technical answer to "why not 1 table" is anomolies and redudancy (what happens if you have the same user twice in your database? what happens if you change their details?)
2016-07-05 17:24:59	Ghostbird	Vady: If you have 10 students with a First and Last name, and 12 tests each. If you store everything in one table, you would store 12 times the same First and Last name for every student. Which is completely pointess.
2016-07-05 17:25:07	bjs	Vady: and why not everything in its own table, then you need to ask what "everything" is
2016-07-05 17:25:13	Vady	bjs

2016-07-05 17:25:57	Ghostbird	Vady: You are trying to make multiple tables to store information for each server. But I assume all servers store similar information.
2016-07-05 17:26:02	_habnabit	Vady, the specific antipattern that we're talking about is two tables with the same schema and same data, whose only difference is some property of that data

2016-07-05 20:21:36	codey	When choosing keywords to use in logging the runtime of a program, is one more cannonical than the other? eg, start_time & end_time, begin_time & finish_time, execution_time & finish_time, etc

2016-07-05 22:57:20	ninjaaron	nedbat: The error will be in the `for` statement, not in the append.
2016-07-05 22:57:26	cyphase	Zequal, are you talking about the code at the top of https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2007/07/functional-functions-and-python.html ? that's an example of what not to do :)

2016-07-05 22:57:59	nedbat	ninjaaron: the exception is from the tokenize() call, right?
2016-07-05 22:58:21	nedbat	ninjaaron: whatever this listcomp is doing, a real loop can do.
2016-07-05 22:58:27	Zequal	cyphase: Well, throughout it though - none of it is ideal as it is 'anti-pattern' correct?
2016-07-05 22:58:30	ninjaaron	nedbat: yeah. It fails when it hits EOF and there are open enclosing characters.

2016-07-05 23:07:54	cyphase	Zequal, the singleton pattern is when there is only one instance of an object (like the list in that example code on that page), or some object/class is restricted to only having one instance; so for example, trying to instantiate the class will always return the same instance, not a new one

2016-07-06 17:00:44	cipher__	emr, Since nobody else is responding, here's my probably incorrect and or obvious and bad advice: I believe you can either use IPC and fork them into literally different processes for parallelism, or make just use threads or coroutines to interleave them concurrently. Python has a global intepreter lock, so you can't actually have parallelism within the same process, which you kind of alluded to.

2016-07-06 18:41:21	Yhg1s	truthadjustr: you are currently assigning to Logger. That's the only way 'Logger.debug(...)' won't be an error. Just assign something else to Logger instead. Like, say, a logging.logger.

It's called to create the class, and its __getattr__ is called when accessing attributes of the class. That's really all that's going on here.

2016-07-06 19:42:22	enamon_	Ah, I want to connect. I see. So socket.connect for remote connections and socket.bind for local (incoming), right?
2016-07-06 19:42:33	Yhg1s	enamon_: more or less. you can also bind outgoing connections.
2016-07-06 19:42:35	JustMondris	oh i selected p 2  in their website instead of p3
2016-07-06 19:42:39	Vgr	Yhg1s: well, 'x in range(101)' looks better to me

2016-07-06 19:42:45	Yhg1s	enamon_: sockets are hard. I highly, highly recommend using a higher-level abstraction, like asyncio or twisted.

2016-07-06 21:03:22	CodeMouse92	DarkPsychic: I'd estimate that 80% of coding is the logical process of design and debugging that tutorials do *for* you. The syntax is the easy thing to learn.

2016-07-06 21:04:55	CodeMouse92	DarkPsychic: So, my best advice, complete the Official Python Tutorial to get the basic syntax, and then just start building that editor. Make it minimilistically simple, and then add features. Jump in with both feet and just learn whatever you need as you go.
2016-07-06 21:05:10	_habnabit	skered-, you want to serve a non-python site while doing authn/authz through python?

2016-07-06 21:07:18	_habnabit	skered-, it would be pretty easy to do by reverse-proxying to a wsgi server running pyramid and having pyramid serve the static content, or reverse-proxying to a twisted.web server that serves the static content
2016-07-06 21:07:31	_habnabit	skered-, twisted.web would probably be more straightforward and performant though

2016-07-06 22:57:48	_habnabit	mathezula, which header?
2016-07-06 22:58:01	mathezula	in http header dumps with the browser.  header key is 'Location'
2016-07-06 22:58:14	_habnabit	mathezula, no, that's a response. requests don't have a Location

2016-07-06 22:59:23	mathezula	right.  so durring authentication, the --response-- (it is in the notes) sends the Location header, in that Location value is an sguid that is formed as a uri var, that value is used in the next request as a uri parameter

2016-07-06 22:59:36	waterCreature	hello, i have this django app, as well as a database that is linked with the django app, and! i also have a script that does serial communication from Arduino, receiving sensor data, the arduino data receiving is done inside a while True: loop, and occasionally, if some database value changes, I want to go inside that while True loop and do serial.
2016-07-06 22:59:36	waterCreature	write("data"), but my current dilemma is that the django app itself is like a program independent of the arduino program.
2016-07-06 22:59:40	_habnabit	mathezula, yes, that's how redirects work
2016-07-06 22:59:55	_habnabit	mathezula, you can tell requests to follow the redirect; you don't have to do it yourself
2016-07-06 23:00:00	mathezula	oh nice
2016-07-06 23:00:49	waterCreature	how do i make the communication between the two, btw, currently, i made a django custom management script to make the arduino script able to access django database, but if i was not running the arduino script via django management script, the arduino script cannot access the database.

2016-07-07 12:41:57	Yhg1s	caitanya: as I said, your code counts them, but doesn't report the count, so how do you know what the result was? How do you know it didn't work?
2016-07-07 12:42:19	[m]adman	hi all, I was just reading about hashing files with MD5 and found MD5 was deprecated in Python 2.5... is this true? can anyone recommend a better hash algo?
2016-07-07 12:42:21	Yhg1s	JustMondris: I don't understand what you're asking for, sorry.
2016-07-07 12:42:43	Yhg1s	[m]adman: the md5 *module* is deprecated in favour of hashlib. The hashlib module has a collection of hashing algorithms available.
2016-07-07 12:42:47	JustMondris	Yhg1s here is what bjs said i should do:<bjs> JustMondris: the user will input a number, say 3, then hit enter. Then type 3 numbers separated by spaces, say "5 1 7" then hit enter again

2016-07-07 12:45:28	django_	i have a list comp: [li.get_text() for li in arr_li] but wanna add a conditional so it only add li.get_text() if it finds a substring

2016-07-07 12:45:56	Yhg1s	django_: you can add that, yes. It does mean li.get_text() gets called twice. You may want a regular for loop for this.

2016-07-07 12:49:31	[m]adman	it has me wondering, if the data were to get corrupt (due to bad sectors perhaps?), would the md5 hash remain the same?
2016-07-07 12:49:37	caitanya	my code only show 2 IPs
2016-07-07 12:49:38	Yhg1s	[m]adman: then collisions are unlikely to matter. single-bit changes are not going to produce the same hash with any of the algorithms in hashlib
2016-07-07 12:49:39	[m]adman	or any of the others
2016-07-07 12:49:54	Yhg1s	[m]adman: even large changes are unlikely to have this effect.
2016-07-07 12:50:07	Yhg1s	[m]adman: however, if you want to be even more sure, yeah, you can store multiple different hashes.
2016-07-07 12:50:10	JustMondris	Yhg1s  enter list without comma
2016-07-07 12:50:11	JustMondris	1245

2016-07-07 12:50:14	[m]adman	okay, so I'm just scaring myself
2016-07-07 12:50:16	JustMondris	thats the output
2016-07-07 12:50:18	Yhg1s	caitanya: how? As I said, your code doesn't output anything.
2016-07-07 12:50:39	Yhg1s	JustMondris: sure. Because there isn't a space in that line. It's just a single number. Not a string of space-separated numbers.
2016-07-07 12:50:53	stealth_	caitanya, is there a link to the code?
2016-07-07 12:51:05	caitanya	yes
2016-07-07 12:51:05	stealth_	caitanya, are you using iptables?
2016-07-07 12:51:14	caitanya	nope
2016-07-07 12:51:23	Yhg1s	[m]adman: md5 has been 'cryptographically broken', and isn't really worth using (no gain, just downsides) -- but even so, being cryptographically broken just means it's possible in some situations to craft collisions. You don't care about collisions, just about integrity.

2016-07-07 16:31:00	bjs	Vady: can you put timestamps in that print on line 293 to see if that line gets printed twice during the line 277 while loop or during the line 270 one
2016-07-07 16:31:15	Wooble	Ubuntu 16 has py3 default and pip does the right thing...
2016-07-07 16:31:16	nshp_	diegoviola: just change the script, that's what a lot of PKGBUILDs do
2016-07-07 16:31:16	MrElendig	python2-pip gives you pip2 and pip2.7, python-pip gives you pip, pip3 and pip3.5
2016-07-07 16:31:38	diegoviola	that's correct
2016-07-07 16:31:41	bjs	Vady: it could just be that it waits a second and "self.bot" is still True when it gets back

2016-07-07 16:32:23	Vady	ok, how do I get a timestamp
2016-07-07 16:32:37	Wooble	(possibly if you have not installed py2's pip you get pip3 aliased to pip)
2016-07-07 16:33:07	SegFaultAX	Vady: datetime.datetime.now() works. time.time() might also be handy.
2016-07-07 16:33:28	diegoviola	thanks for the help, I appreciate it
2016-07-07 16:33:34	_habnabit	Vady, this is one of the problems with asyncio's approach of 'loop with a sleep in it'; it's likely that you're just calling self.rcg multiple times

2016-07-07 16:37:00	_habnabit	Vady, but it's easy to fix, even this way: assign the task created to an instance attribute and check if it's already been set before calling self.rcg

2016-07-07 17:46:52	mathezula	doesn't cpython require a special compiler to produce C code that's then compiled into an executable binary?

2016-07-07 17:47:54	tos9	noimnotninevolt: Extra context switching is an added cost, yes. It's worth it, and it's a premature optimization to assume it will matter.
2016-07-07 17:47:59	_habnabit	noimnotninevolt, i think you got it backward, anyway. on modern processors with NUMA, it's shared-state concurrency like threads that has more context-switching penalty
