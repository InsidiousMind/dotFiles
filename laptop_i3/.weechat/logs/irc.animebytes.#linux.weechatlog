2016-10-11 14:16:54	jA_mOn	My favourite Linux distro is Android Gingerbread
2016-10-11 14:17:18	jA_mOn	at least it doesn't have systemd
2016-10-11 14:17:24	insidious15	hahahaha
2016-10-11 14:17:27	q66	it has worse things
2016-10-11 14:17:30	insidious15	systemd is a monolithic beast
2016-10-11 14:17:40	q66	like the bionic libc
2016-10-11 14:17:42	q66	what a piece of garbage
2016-10-11 14:36:09	WhatsCS	I need to modularize my code, make everything callable. Issue is, I use a specific thing that's created in an init function
2016-10-11 14:36:19	WhatsCS	how can I get that specific var
2016-10-11 14:36:24	WhatsCS	and make it global
2016-10-11 14:36:58	WhatsCS	I'll post code
2016-10-11 14:37:44	insidious15	WhatsCS: what langauge/
2016-10-11 14:38:02	WhatsCS	javascript
2016-10-11 14:38:25	WhatsCS	I'm trying to make a fairly flushed out lightbox
2016-10-11 14:38:50	WhatsCS	with a mix of css animations and js shit 
2016-10-11 14:39:07	insidious15	ew javascript
2016-10-11 14:39:11	WhatsCS	yeah
2016-10-11 14:39:11	insidious15	Typescript :)
2016-10-11 14:39:15	WhatsCS	https://0bin.whatscs.com/paste/Hw95qnZi#lHbObg0iXbYngwfWVGujaYl4U28C084Y4S8b4zlbyhG

2016-10-11 14:39:24	WhatsCS	Lumi, ^
2016-10-11 14:39:26	WhatsCS	pls halp
2016-10-11 14:40:52	insidious15	i'm not fond of JS :/ haha
2016-10-11 14:41:17	Lumi	huh?
2016-10-11 14:41:19	WhatsCS	yeah this is the most js I've done on my own
2016-10-11 14:41:27	WhatsCS	Lumi, how do make everything callable
2016-10-11 14:41:35	WhatsCS	I'm trying to get a slideshow type controls
2016-10-11 14:41:40	Lumi	callable in what sense?
2016-10-11 14:42:00	WhatsCS	and I feel like I need to make the creation of the image for the lightbox callable from outside the main run function
2016-10-11 14:42:31	boussitzenne	so like lightbox('asd.jpg')?
2016-10-11 14:42:37	WhatsCS	no
2016-10-11 14:42:41	WhatsCS	well
2016-10-11 14:42:42	WhatsCS	hmm
2016-10-11 14:42:46	boussitzenne	but like...?
2016-10-11 14:43:34	WhatsCS	I'm reading to double check how I want this to work
2016-10-11 14:43:44	WhatsCS	I thought I did
2016-10-11 14:44:02	WhatsCS	basically I have no clue how to call the next image on the page
2016-10-11 14:44:16	WhatsCS	since .next() doesn't seem to be grabbing what I need it to
2016-10-11 14:45:03	boussitzenne	so you want to show the next image?
2016-10-11 14:45:22	WhatsCS	or prev
2016-10-11 14:45:27	WhatsCS	and it isn't always an image
2016-10-11 14:47:13	boussitzenne	you might want to grab all the elements that open the lightbox on the page and choose the next from from the current one
2016-10-11 14:47:45	WhatsCS	that's what I thought it was doing in getNExt
2016-10-11 14:47:48	WhatsCS	getNext()
2016-10-11 14:48:00	WhatsCS	but it wasn't, or at least didn't seem like it was
2016-10-11 14:48:25	boussitzenne	iirc .next() only works for siblings
2016-10-11 14:48:32	WhatsCS	ah
2016-10-11 14:48:38	WhatsCS	that would explain it then
2016-10-11 14:50:00	boussitzenne	anyways, i'm off to sleep, good luck
2016-10-11 14:50:10	WhatsCS	cya
