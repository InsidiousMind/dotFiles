2016-10-14 20:00:25	ChameleonSix	Vodka
2016-10-14 20:00:31	dunnp	considering it is just unflavored distilled alcohol it should always be the same
2016-10-14 20:00:31	px	yeah most of ours is imported no?
2016-10-14 20:00:56	dunnp	titos is nice and smooth though

2016-10-14 20:01:23	@wonklab	we've got some sake brewery in town, too
2016-10-14 20:01:42	@wonklab	I never really associated Texas with vodka.
2016-10-14 20:01:46	@wonklab	seems weird

2016-10-14 20:03:14	dunnp	we always get hornitos tequila

2016-10-14 20:09:24	@wonklab	I love me some maragaritas.
2016-10-14 20:09:54	dunnp	dangerous because it doesnt taste alcoholic but is 80% tequila
2016-10-14 20:11:09	@wonklab	yeah, good tequila is pretty close to a margarita all by itself
