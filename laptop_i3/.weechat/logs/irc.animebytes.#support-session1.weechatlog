2016-10-11 15:21:28	insidious15	hello!
2016-10-11 15:21:49	Chii	How may I help you?
2016-10-11 15:22:08	insidious15	So, uhh, I have a bunch of H&R's and i'm trying to make up for them, but, I no longer have the files....
2016-10-11 15:22:23	insidious15	So i've been trying to DL them again, but my DL priviledges are revokde
2016-10-11 15:22:27	insidious15	revoked*
2016-10-11 15:22:44	Chii	You can still download the hit and run themselves
2016-10-11 15:22:50	Chii	Only other dls are not allowed
2016-10-11 15:23:34	insidious15	ahok
2016-10-11 15:23:49	insidious15	so even if i have 10+ H&R's i can download those files
2016-10-11 15:24:21	Chii	The hit and runs themselves yes
2016-10-11 15:24:25	Chii	Not to be abused ov
2016-10-11 15:24:32	Chii	obviously*
2016-10-11 15:24:39	insidious15	ahh I see, I think it was a problem with my client and the port
2016-10-11 15:25:00	Chii	Possibly
2016-10-11 15:25:07	insidious15	I just saw that the tracker said "Your DL privileges are disabled" and that the dl rate was 0
2016-10-11 15:25:21	insidious15	it's still downloading though, OK
2016-10-11 15:25:23	insidious15	thanks haha
2016-10-11 15:25:44	insidious15	I'll slowly dig myself out of this hole
2016-10-11 15:26:07	Chii	haha have fun I guess
2016-10-11 15:26:11	insidious15	lol
2016-10-11 15:26:13	Chii	How many hit and runs in total?
2016-10-11 15:26:19	insidious15	13
2016-10-11 15:26:30	insidious15	this is my first private tracker, I didn't really know what I was doing
2016-10-11 15:26:53	Chii	ah makes sense
2016-10-11 15:26:58	Chii	13 is not bad tbh
2016-10-11 15:27:00	insidious15	lol, thought freeleech meant didn't have to seed. Didn't read all the rules, basically
2016-10-11 15:27:09	Chii	I've seen people in the xxx threshod before
2016-10-11 15:27:13	insidious15	Damn
2016-10-11 15:27:18	insidious15	don't even know how that happens
2016-10-11 15:27:20	Chii	yeah
2016-10-11 15:27:36	Chii	auto leech and seedboxes/hdd issues can do that
2016-10-11 15:27:47	insidious15	ahh true 
2016-10-11 15:28:40	insidious15	Had a seedbox once, those things have crazy download/upload speeds
