2016-10-10 11:12:56	kosan	What's this parser being written in? I'm going to guess Java.

2016-10-14 12:48:20	purplex88	sbrg: yeah the table doesn't mention which array
2016-10-14 12:48:53	purplex88	sbrg: constant time to insert/delete from its end, right?
2016-10-14 12:48:54	sbrg	purplex88: "which kind" were probably the wrong words to use. "array" on its own is pretty unambiguous, but it depends on what you are doing with the array and so on.
2016-10-14 12:49:08	Guest54536	yitz, well, it wouldn't be fair to say even trivially that you could achieve both availability and consistency on a single host?
2016-10-14 12:49:32	sbrg	if there is space, and you are inserting at the end, then yes. if you are inserting or removing from the middle, you may or may not have to move everything else in the array, which is linear
2016-10-14 12:49:34	yitz	Guest54536: No. Because those words are defined in the context of a distributed system :P

2016-10-14 12:50:08	deniska	Guest54536: if in a single node non-distributed system a single node fails, you get neither availability nor consistency :)
2016-10-14 12:50:11	purplex88	sbrg: right so in stack and queue it takes constant time because you insert at end

2016-10-14 12:50:29	deniska	Guest54536: a single node is not a distributed system

2016-10-14 12:52:45	Guest54536	deniska, I understand. But can't I just rebut by saying in a distributed you're assuming one or more nodes are operational, so I can do the same with my single host scenario :s. ...I'll go learn more about CAP and stop making trifling arguments

When you start with a "dry Java tutorial", you create a loop, learn about variables and then you say: And now what? In WebDesign, you create your loop, and you have three buttons. Two more lines give you a nice background and a new file gives you a login system.

2016-10-14 18:09:41	lyinch	It looks as if you really try to search a counter example of how it can be done with an already existing programm, just to not learn it. If it bores you that much, just chose something different as a hobby. With such a mindset, you'll never go far in programming, nor enjoy it

2016-10-14 18:16:59	lyinch	Smilerut: Nope. If you like it, then it doesn't feel like learning. Sure, there are always some harder parts but it will come naturally. You seem like you really try to fight against getting new knowledge with all your excuses and counter-arguments. For me, you just lack discipline and try to find excuses for this lack. Just try something else that comes easier to you and maybe pick up programming

2016-10-14 21:28:13	okuu	I'm revisiting SICP. More precisely, the interval arithmetic exercise from chapter 2. And it seems to me that exercise 2.16 is ridiculously stupid, for anyone who understands "correlation" and (lack of) "independence".
2016-10-14 21:28:31	okuu	But the book says the problem is "very difficult".
2016-10-14 21:28:35	okuu	Am I missing something?
2016-10-14 21:30:02	okuu	Also, this is why you compute errors using total differentials, rather than interval arithmetic. Interval arithmetic assumes the inputs are independent from each other.

I have identified all table names in the entire databases via: SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE' and located a table titled db (in mysql database) that I'd like to get data from.

2016-10-14 21:37:46	okuu	exio4: The problem is basically the following one. If you implement interval arithmetic naively, then algebraically equivalent expressions can yield different results. The example given is the formula for calculating the resistance of a parallel circuit: "R = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2)" vs "R = R1 * R2 / (R1 + R2)".
2016-10-14 21:40:12	okuu	exio4: And the question asks whether this shortcoming can be eliminated.

2016-10-14 21:43:27	okuu	I can think of at least two possible ways: Monte Carlo simulation (downside: too brute force) and using total differentials (downside: doing it exactly requires symbolic algebra).

2016-10-14 21:45:04	okuu	In the Monte Carlo approach, you consider a distinction between independent vs. dependent variables. The result of evaluating an arithmetic expression is always a dependent variable. Then, to compute approximately the range of any dependent variable, you generate lots of values for the independent variables, and plug them into the formula that yields the dependent variable.
2016-10-14 21:45:12	okuu	So... brute force, as I said.

2016-10-14 21:48:29	okuu	In the total differential approach, you build an AST for the expression that computes the dependent variable. If the expression is built from differentiable functions (like all basic arithmetic operations), then you can compute the total differential of the dependent variable from the differentials of its indepdent inputs.
