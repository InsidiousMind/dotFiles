2016-10-11 12:46:32	+Ew	what?
2016-10-11 12:46:42	+Ew	no you have to be seeding said torrent
2016-10-11 12:47:00	+Ew	you need to get the files (100%) and seed
2016-10-11 12:47:06	insidious15	oh right seeding not uploading hah
2016-10-11 12:47:11	q66	insidious15: you can download the files again
2016-10-11 12:47:21	+Ew	and seed for x amount of time (visible on your profile) until its not HnR anymore
2016-10-11 12:47:30	q66	even if you have over 10 h&rs you can still leech files you have h&rs for

2016-10-11 12:50:14	Setsuhan	what is docker?
2016-10-11 12:50:24	scj643	docker is a container for running apps
2016-10-11 12:50:25	insidious15	it's OK. I just setup a computer to just seed/download torrents i can ssh into from university, and then i can get back to equilibrium
2016-10-11 12:50:42	Setsuhan	I see
2016-10-11 12:50:43	q66	only seed time matters so just seed for the required time and that's it
2016-10-11 12:50:51	q66	doesn't even have to upload any amount
2016-10-11 12:50:57	+Jigsy	I always try to seed to 1:0.
2016-10-11 12:51:01	q66	i checked your snatches and it's all freeleech
2016-10-11 12:51:08	scj643	Also the server I was running it on is my irc bouncer

2016-10-11 12:51:48	+Ew	insidious15 you want to use private trackers only
2016-10-11 12:51:49	+Jigsy	I remember when they used to be infinite, though.
2016-10-11 12:51:59	+Jigsy	Until I had to move stuff around.
2016-10-11 12:52:09	+Ew	public trackers are subject to "anti-piracy" groups data sniffing
2016-10-11 12:52:17	insidious15	yeah i know
2016-10-11 12:52:17	+Ew	which can lead to copyright blackmail letters

2016-10-11 12:52:52	+Ew	q66 it might happen in Sweden soon..

2016-10-11 12:55:47	q66	Jigsy: format support is determined by the build of ffmpeg they use

2016-10-11 12:59:42	q66	i realized they can't statically link either way
2016-10-11 12:59:47	q66	because ffmpeg licensing
2016-10-11 13:00:00	q66	so all you technically have to do is sneak in an alternative version of the ffmpeg .so file :P

2016-10-11 13:38:14	+satoriseeker	i had bad luck with corrupted / incomplete files lately
2016-10-11 13:38:20	+satoriseeker	good to know its not my HDD
2016-10-11 13:38:28	q66	if you have either over 10 hnrs or under 0.2 ratio that will happen
2016-10-11 13:39:06	insidious15	q66: so, even if i'm downloading my H&R's, I can't
2016-10-11 13:39:09	+satoriseeker	guess what im doing today

2016-10-11 13:40:49	VinhSama	build the wall, TRUMP IT
2016-10-11 13:40:55	q66	i was actually going to do that

2016-10-11 13:41:04	+satoriseeker	nah
2016-10-11 13:41:09	+satoriseeker	if you're gonna do it now, do it
2016-10-11 13:41:18	q66	still donwloading the file because the nyaa torrent barely has any seeders
2016-10-11 13:41:20	+satoriseeker	im getting ready to go out
2016-10-11 13:41:28	+satoriseeker	yeah
2016-10-11 13:41:47	q66	i looked in the file
2016-10-11 13:41:50	q66	it's completely corrupted
2016-10-11 13:41:54	q66	doesn't even resemble mkv :P

2016-10-11 13:42:33	+satoriseeker	for som reason i'm banned from #horriblesubs IRC channel hahaha

2016-10-11 13:42:46	q66	anyway let's see if the nyaa file works
2016-10-11 13:42:47	+satoriseeker	i can't remember ever going there before, i literally had to add Rizon to my IRC
2016-10-11 13:42:49	VinhSama	just add .mkv to the end of the file, that fixes everything
2016-10-11 13:42:58	BDIkaros	Probably affected by a broader ban then
2016-10-11 13:43:17	VinhSama	ah yes, broadband

2016-10-11 13:44:05	q66	it's probably just the AB torrent that is wrong
2016-10-11 13:44:07	+satoriseeker	ah true they could have custom hostmask bans affecting only non registered users

2016-10-11 13:44:42	q66	i'll be able to tell you in a few minutes :P

2016-10-11 13:46:23	+satoriseeker	oh goddamnit
2016-10-11 13:46:34	+satoriseeker	its becuse my IRC client set up my default nick to be guest3334
2016-10-11 13:46:41	q66	i think you're leeching from me now :P
2016-10-11 13:46:42	+satoriseeker	and #horriblesubs bans guest* nicks

2016-10-11 13:48:14	redhead	I'm currently checking out the various tabs of information available when you click on a torrent in your client. About the trackers tab: disabling them will basically shut down all peers trying to get to your through them?
2016-10-11 13:48:37	+satoriseeker	nice series so far
2016-10-11 13:48:44	+satoriseeker	makes me reminisce about my attempt to be a DJ :p
2016-10-11 13:49:09	q66	ye it's pretty good
2016-10-11 13:49:24	VinhSama	were you banned for playing a bunch of tayswiffy? or somethjing like that

2016-10-11 13:50:04	+satoriseeker	meanwhile i made a fake announcement that the radio was only for AB Gold members and set it on repeat for 2 hours and got away with it

2016-10-11 13:54:57	VinhSama	so it's valid to say that katy perry is perfect for AB radio
2016-10-11 13:55:02	duelistg|lapt	it should be stuff like Detroit Metal City
2016-10-11 13:55:07	duelistg|lapt	VinhSama: lol no
2016-10-11 13:55:18	VinhSama	in fact, back when ab radio came back up
2016-10-11 13:55:20	VinhSama	people were defending djs
2016-10-11 13:55:24	VinhSama	saying they can play whatever they want
2016-10-11 13:55:32	+satoriseeker	one was explicitly a LA chicano themed nightclub
2016-10-11 13:55:35	VinhSama	cause it's their creative freedom, and they're volunteering their time

2016-10-11 14:25:37	redhead	insidious15: so when I check the torrents that I download from AB, they got inside of them a tracker link with my key. What if along that AB tracker link I also add in other trackers?
2016-10-11 14:25:47	redhead	What happens to that torrent file?
2016-10-11 14:26:01	redhead	Will AB pick up my upload ratio from other trackers too?
2016-10-11 14:26:02	Mert7	duelistg|lapt, I wonder how many people do that shit and end up being wrong
2016-10-11 14:27:24	redhead	I'm asking cuz I'm fairly unaware of how the torrent protocol works.
2016-10-11 14:27:31	redhead	Maybe some of your know better.
