# dotFiles
These are the DotFiles for my PowerArrow AwesomeWM configuration.

To Install:

copy awesome  to ~.config/
It should look something like:

cp awesome ~/.config/

copy the contents of .ncmpcpp to ~/.ncmpcpp (same commands as above)

To get the rc.lua mpd Widget working, make SURE to have mpc installed (media placer command line interface). Otherwise, it will not work. 
Also, make sure to look through your .ncmpcpp/config and .mpd/mpd.conf to make sure all the settings are correct (especially with reference to host/server/port)

copy the contents of .weechat to ~/.weechat/ (same as above)

If you want the URXVT config, copy Xresources and move it to your home directory (~/)
though, i would recommend looking through and comparing your .Xresources to mine, and simply copying using regular copy-paste commands to avoid potential  conflicts.

To get VIM working:

	Install vundle
	copy my .vimrc  to your home directory (~/)
	open vim, and do :PluginInstall to install all the plugins

For .zshrc configuration, make sure to have zsh installed along with oh-my-zsh. The Installation of these falls out of the scope of this guide, but heres the link to the oh-my-zsh page refer to the oh-my-zsh

To install the same zsh theme as me, you will have to install pre-patched unicode fonts. This also falls out of the scope of this guide. Look into oh-my-zsh themes. Heres the wiki:

To get the rc.lua mpd Widget working, make SURE to have mpc installed (media placer command line interface). Otherwise, it will not work. 
Also, make sure to look through your .ncmpcpp/config and .mpd/mpd.conf to make sure all the settings are correct (especially with reference to host/server/port)

DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOUR COMPUTER/CONFIGURATION.


Thanks!

everything above was for AwesomeWM
I will update this in the future for my i3 config, but I don't think I customized it enough yet. It's a sweet setup but feels too much like the one I took from
Will update with instructions when finished ricing

Ricing is Love, Ricing is Life.

I'm not addicted, I swear.
